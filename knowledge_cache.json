[{"fileName":"Civilians.txt","chunkIndex":0,"content":"Civilians will work on a per-property basis with us initially being allowed a maximum of 5 civilians per property for properties of 4 tiles or more. There will be 5 civilian types or classes to begin with. The Data Analyst analyzes your property and droid data to give you useful insights. The Droid Technician will automatically charge your droids for you when idle. The Ether Dispenser will automatically dispense or give the Ether collected by your droids. The Raid Commander will allow you to assign your droids to auto-raid, although this will only be repeatedly going to the same property over and over.

Vlog 7 and Dev vlog 8 Transcripts.docx","chunkIndex":0,"content":"Dev Vlog 7 Transcript:Dear Earth 2 players and community welcome to vlog number 7 where we'll be introducing visuals and details about two new ecosim buildings the petrol processor and the gold polymerizer we'll also share further details about our phase 2 ecosim you're now viewing the petrol processor it's a layer 2 building which belongs to and marks the beginning of the coatings technology branch the blueprint for the petrol processor will become available for research via the research lab but has a few requirements that need to be met before this option becomes available the first requirement is that layer two of the ecosim has been officially released by earth2 the second requirement is the research lab has been successfully upgraded to layer 2 on that specific property the third requirement is that the player has successfully constructed the lignator the petrifier and the water processor and each building remains in an active state these three ecosim buildings do not need to exist on the same property but at least one of each must exist across any other properties owned by that player unrestricted at any other location around the world here you're viewing the gold polymerizer which is also a layer two building the gold polymerizer belongs to and marks the beginning of the metallurgic chemistry branch the blueprint for the gold polymerizer will become available for research via the research lab but as with the petrol processor it also has a few requirements that need to be met before this option becomes available the first requirement is that layer two of the ecosim has been officially released by earth2 the second requirement is the research lab has been successfully upgraded to layer two on that specific property the third requirement is that the player has successfully constructed the water processor and it remains in an active state the water processor does not need to exist on the same property but must exist at least once across any other properties owned by that player unrestricted at any other location around the world should a player deconstruct or sell a property with an eco-sim building that was technically supporting another eco-sim building all buildings supported by the now non-existing ecosim building will cease to operate until the player rebuilds the missing technology link once the blueprint for the petrol processor or the gold polymerizer has been researched each respective building will follow the standard process of construction being placed as a hollow building after which time the player will be able to command their construction droids to commence construction in order for the construction droids to begin they must have direct access to the relevant building blocks and materials required for each relevant building for the petrol processor this will mean construction wood concrete rolled steel industrial water and oil the petrol processor will be able to produce lacquers coatings and paint including self-luminous paint by using wood limestone industrial water and refined oil for the gold polymerizer the construction droids will require construction wood concrete rolled steel industrial water and gold to successfully complete construction after construction this building will then be able to produce gold bars by using industrial water and gold some eco-sim buildings will be able to store a limited amount of produce locally but once that limit is exceeded building blocks or raw materials will need to be relocated via transportation to other storage areas properties construction sites or trading hubs hollow buildings will provide an expansion of storage space on the property they've been placed on customization is very important for earth 2 and as you can see in the video each building and vehicle is individually customizable players will be able to take advantage of this freedom by editing and saving customizations on buildings vehicles and other things they own this freedom of expression will further support things like guild association neighbourhood synchronization or just simple personal preference as players have the ability to unify or diversify how their presence is felt by others what we're showcasing in these vlogs are visual representations of how buildings and vehicles will appear in e2 v1 our digital earth during phase 2.5 there will be a transition period starting with e2 e2v1 reflecting actions from the earth2 website which will gradually progress to more interaction and experiences taking place directly on e2 v1 this will eventually step by step move to first person view and beyond as the development of e2v1 improves and advances over time it's been mentioned that ether is life and that essence is power essence will play a key role in powering many things inside of earth 2. adding incredible utility to such a valuable earth to resource for example players will be able to power their mentors with essence at tweakable rates which can be adjusted to suit their desired strategy such as producing better economized raw material replication or focus more on ether to essence transformation in the future players will also have the ability to stake their essence in very special ways to provide power support for other players or even cities at a mutually agreeable reward allowing such essence to be utilized for a magnitude of varying purposes we're excited to release more details around how this will function closer to the launch of the essence token

Vlog 7.docx","chunkIndex":0,"content":"Dev Vlog 7: TranscriptDear Earth 2 players and community, welcome to vlog number 7 where we'll be introducing visuals and details about two new ecosim buildings: the petrol processor and the gold polymerizer. We'll also share further details about our phase 2 ecosim. You're now viewing the petrol processor, a layer 2 building belonging to and marking the beginning of the coatings technology branch. The blueprint for the petrol processor will become available for research via the research lab, but it has a few requirements that need to be met before this option becomes available. The first requirement is that layer two of the ecosim has been officially released by Earth2. The second requirement is the research lab has been successfully upgraded to layer 2 on that specific property. The third requirement is that the player has successfully constructed the lignator, the petrifier, and the water processor, and each building remains in an active state. These three ecosim buildings do not need to exist on the same property, but at least one of each must exist across any other properties owned by that player unrestricted at any other location around the world. Here you're viewing the gold polymerizer, also a layer 2 building belonging to and marking the beginning of the metallurgic chemistry branch. The blueprint for the gold polymerizer will become available for research via the research lab, but, like the petrol processor, it has a few requirements that need to be met before this option becomes available. The first requirement is that layer two of the ecosim has been officially released by Earth2. The second requirement is the research lab has been successfully upgraded to layer 2 on that specific property. The third requirement is that the player has successfully constructed the water processor, and it remains in an active state. The water processor does not need to exist on the same property but must exist at least once across any other properties owned by that player unrestricted at any other location around the world. Should a player deconstruct or sell a property with an eco-sim building that was technically supporting another eco-sim building, all buildings supported by the now non-existing ecosim building will cease to operate until the player rebuilds the missing technology link. Once the blueprint for the petrol processor or the gold polymerizer has been researched, each respective building will follow the standard process of construction, being placed as a hollow building. After which time, the player will be able to command their construction droids to commence construction. In order for the construction droids to begin, they must have direct access to the relevant building blocks and materials required for each relevant building. For the petrol processor, this will mean construction wood, concrete, rolled steel, industrial water, and oil. The petrol processor will be able to produce lacquers, coatings, and paint, including self-luminous paint, by using wood, limestone, industrial water, and refined oil. For the gold polymerizer, the construction droids will require construction wood, concrete, rolled steel, industrial water, and gold to successfully complete construction. After construction, this building will then be able to produce gold bars by using industrial water and gold. Some eco-sim buildings will be able to store a limited amount of produce locally, but once that limit is exceeded, building blocks or raw materials will need to be relocated via transportation to other storage areas, properties, construction sites, or trading hubs. Hollow buildings will provide an expansion of storage space on the property they've been placed on. Customization is very important for Earth 2, and as you can see in the video, each building and vehicle is individually customizable. Players will be able to take advantage of this freedom by editing and saving customizations on buildings, vehicles, and other things they own. This freedom of expression will further support things like guild association, neighborhood synchronization, or just simple personal preference, as players have the ability to unify or diversify how their presence is felt by others. What we're showcasing in these vlogs are visual representations of how buildings and vehicles will appear in E2V1, our digital Earth. During phase 2.5, there will be a transition period starting with E2V1 reflecting actions from the Earth2 website, which will gradually progress to more interaction and experiences taking place directly on E2V1. This will eventually, step by step, move to first-person view and beyond as the development of E2V1 improves and advances over time. It's been mentioned that ether is life, and that essence is power. Essence will play a key role in powering many things inside of Earth 2, adding incredible utility to such a valuable Earth 2 resource. For example, players will be able to power their mentors with essence at tweakable rates, which can be adjusted to suit their desired strategy, such as producing better economized raw material replication or focusing more on ether to essence transformation. In the future, players will also have the ability to stake their essence in very special ways to provide power support for other players or even cities at a mutually agreeable reward, allowing such essence to be utilized for a magnitude of varying purposes. We're excited to release more details around how this will function closer to the launch of the essence token.

Vlog 8.docx","chunkIndex":0,"content":"Dev Vlog 8: Transcript Dear Earth2 players and community, welcome to vlog number 8 where we'll be sharing visuals and further details related to our terrain rendering shown in real time, including the confirmed uniform size of every Earth-2 tile. Please note that the visuals shown here are works in progress and do not represent final results. For example, the terrain is only displayed in low detailed view, and no close-up detail layers or realistic biomes have been added yet. Here we're in the Austrian Alps at sunrise. We'll be placing a reference cube in the world, which corresponds to the exact size of an Earth2 land tile. The grid lines overlaid on the terrain show how Earth-2 land tiles are located on the map. It's important to note that final close-up artist-authored biomes have not been displayed during today's footage. This is a scenic view of Iceland. Note that Earth-2 land tiles are 19.08 meters on each side, which is equivalent to the circumference of the Earth divided by the number of tiles around the equator. All tiles in Earth 2 are equally sized in our 3D representation of the world, no matter where the tile is located. Now, let's visit the Krenitzen volcano in Russia. Even though the scale of our world is massive, and we're traveling great distances, the rendering is shown in real time with a high frame rate in our editor. In this location, we'll be overlaying actual Mapbox satellite imagery on top of our terrain system to demonstrate the accuracy of our rendering. Note how closely the 3D-rendered lake shoreline matches real-world satellite data. Whether land tiles are located at water level on the equator or on the highest mountain peak at the poles, all land tiles are the same size since we transform and stretch the world geometry onto a spherical surface, which allows us to be compatible with Mapbox. Our team is excited to see what players choose to build inside our clean slate, pristine digital version of Earth as E2V1 progresses over time. For the next location, we'll head over to the East Coast of the US and visit New York City. You may recognize Ellis Island in New York Harbor, home to the iconic historical landmark of the Statue of Liberty. As we turn on the Mapbox satellite overlay, you can see again how closely our Earth-2 rendering matches one-to-one with the real world. To cross-check the location, we'll copy the coordinates and then switch over to Google Earth and plug in the same spot. As you can see, we're looking at Flagpole Plaza on Liberty Island. Again, next, we'll copy the coordinates from Google Earth into Earth 2 and locate the same property on the Earth 2 website corresponding to 4 land tiles. We can now go back to our terrain rendering and highlight those same four tiles on Earth 2 by placing reference cubes at that location. Finally, we can toggle the Mapbox overlay off and on, showing the actual Earth 2 terrain system underneath. Note how land tiles on the Earth 2 website match up perfectly with Earth 2 rendered terrain and Mapbox. Let's find the nearby Passaic River, which stretches from New York to New Jersey here on the East Coast. Even in a densely populated area with high curvature along the shoreline, enabling the Mapbox overlay shows how closely the Earth 2 rendering matches up with real-world data. Although square land tiles don't work especially well from a long-range globe view perspective, they're a perfect fit for the web Mercator map coordinate system that everybody is familiar with from online map services. Overlays like this will make it very interesting to see what players have decided to build inside Earth 2. When compared back to the same Earth 1 location, we're now rotating the globe to bring Southern California into view below. We can see the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. We'll zoom down to Mount Langley. This natural mountain peak is an excellent location to verify the uniformity of our land tile sizes. We'll place a series of 10 reference cubes along the mountain ridge above the terrain. Note how the size and position align perfectly with the grid lines. Next, we'll fly over to Mount Rainier using a camera speed of 250,000 kilometres per hour and leave the reference cubes behind as markers. Although Earth 2 tile size is often described using a rough measurement of 10 by 10 meters, as stated in this video, the precise size is 19.08 meters on each side. When zooming in for a close-up view, we see the world stretched in the same way as in Mapbox but spherified, which means the surface is projected onto a sphere from the top down. Designing and building our own system in a similar way allowed us to be fully compatible with what is presented on Mapbox and in turn perfectly match player-owned tile locations. It also means our solution is fully compatible with what is presented by the world's biggest mapping companies and globally accepted and used by millions of people every day. Now, we'll leave Mount Rainier and head back to Mount Langley to check on the 10 reference cubes we placed there. One challenge when working with a large-scale data set, which is the size of Earth, is to maintain accurate numerical precision. This can be problematic as floating-point numbers grow larger in scale, leaving less space for precision. The resulting loss of data precision can cause many issues, including placing objects in the wrong location. We've addressed this in our terrain system, and as we return to our original location, we see that the cubes we positioned earlier are still correctly located in the exact same spot. We're glad we could share this update with you and hope the first part of this video has been interesting and informative. Welcome to part two of our vlog. We'd like to introduce you to a group of new buildings before displaying our inter-building road system. The first is the Petrifier, a layer 1 building of the cements branch. As with most layer 1 buildings, the Petrifier blueprint can be researched in the research lab as soon as Ecosim buildings are released. Once the blueprint is researched, the player will be able to select an area to place the blueprint as a hollow building and then command construction droids to use previously woven and locally transported limestone sand and fresh water to build the Petrifier in its layer one form. The Petrifier has a rectangular footprint spreading across two tiles and has the ability to transform limestone sand and fresh water into concrete, the key building block of the cements branch. Next, we have the Steel Mill, which is the first building in the Steels branch. The Steel Mill can be researched in the research lab, after which time it can be placed as a hollow building and built with construction droids using previously woven and locally transported iron ore, wood, and industrial water. In its layer one form, the Steel Mill has a rectangular footprint spread across two tiles and has the ability to transform iron ore, wood, and industrial water into rolled steel, the core building block of the Steels branch. We will now showcase some residential and commercial building options. The first one here is an example of a medium-sized residential building spread across four tiles, with a particularly sleek-looking hover car being spread across four tiles. This house can support small gardens, parking spaces, and more. There will be options to have houses on small tile lots as well. Even buildings like this can provide multiple utility inside of Earth too. For instance, this building could be used to set up a virtual personal space for the owner or occupier, which other players could visit. This same small building could also be tailored to reproduce civilians such as sycophants, proteges, or votaries, depending on property-affiliated factions.

Vlog 8.docx","chunkIndex":1,"content":"nstance, this building could be used to set up a virtual personal space for the owner or occupier, which other players could visit. This same small building could also be tailored to reproduce civilians such as sycophants, proteges, or votaries, depending on property-affiliated factions. Remember, we are now using the correct tile size of 19.08 by 19.08 meters, while all previous vlogs have used 10 by 10 meters as the tile size. Players looking for more building space may opt to construct larger residential buildings, which can provide more utility. These larger buildings will be able to support more internal spaces usable by the owner for either personal use, to house faction civilians, or even to lease out to other players. Some buildings will support multi-purpose zones for added utility. These are buildings that can be used not only as personal spaces to house civilians or lease to players but also to provide facilities that train or educate civilians and avatars to learn new skills. Larger residential buildings will have specialized purposes, making them important for different reasons depending on the player's goals or strategies. As always, each building will be customizable and support the ability to display billboards for advertising or promotion of personally chosen messages. A common misconception is that Earth 2 will force players to only be able to purchase buildings directly from Earth 2, but this is incorrect. We want players to play the eco-sim, trade, buy, sell, transport, manage, intercept, and similar activities, which will allow players to acquire key game assets and currencies that will then provide the ability to own and build themselves, all made possible from successfully participating inside of Earth 2. Should they wish to, players not Earth 2 will then be able to sell properties along with the buildings they have diligently constructed over time. This approach is another clear representation of our long-term goal to design features which have focus to benefit the player first, not Earth 2. Each player looking to play the eco-sim and earn inside of Earth 2 will require a personal virtual space for their avatar to reside. These players will have the ability to lease spaces from building owners or otherwise lease spaces based on an eco-sim agreement with other players who can provide virtual spaces in return for services. Once those services are completed by the leasing player, that player may conduct their own business to earn more within the ecosim. If smart and the opportunity is available, they may even be able to conduct some of their own business while on ecosim agreement service work for other players. Players will be able to earn essence resources, building blocks, and similar digital items for themselves by transporting, trading, buying, selling, intercepting, and more. We've known for some time that tiles on Earth 2 were larger than 10 by 10 meters. The actual tile size of 19 by 19 meters allowed us the space we needed to develop an inter-building road system that would function even in heavily purchased areas where every adjacent tile is actively owned by multiple players. We like to think of part of this additional space as kind of a community area for infrastructure that supports transportation and allows for better navigational access. Over time, players will have the option to select different building combinations, which will result in different-shaped inter-building road systems. These systems have the core goal of enabling every building to be directly accessible by a vehicle if so desired. As cities grow, there will be new types of road infrastructure and traffic systems available, and these will be displayed in future Earth 2 vlogs. We also plan to demonstrate how the construction of buildings on non-flat terrain, such as mountains or hilly areas, will be possible outside of cities. Earth 2 will, of course, also support a wide variety of population settlements, similar to what we have in Earth 1. Low-density rural areas, as well as small towns with lower population, will be enabled as well and can be connected to city centres in some cases via hover roads. You'll note that some buildings in this view appear to occupy parts of the same tile. This is because we plan to support multiple options when placing certain groups of buildings, so players can merge their structures into different layouts for varying benefits. For example, a player could reduce the number of tiles required for some buildings when they're constructed together in a group, such as the two medium-sized houses spread over six tiles, as opposed to the eight tiles that would normally be required to support those two houses. Although this is just a prototype using digital assets, the city scene shown here is fully dynamic and interactive. Lighting, shadows, and reflections are calculated and updated in real-time and can represent day or night and will support various weather conditions in the future. Vehicles move smoothly through the scene, both on land and in the air. Rooftop billboards rotate to display advertising images, and the camera can be placed anywhere in the scene. It's been mentioned that ether is life and essence is power. The control and use of ether will be a strategic decision for players in the future, as ether will have the ability to create and support life on Earth too. Most living things on Earth too will have some form of connection back to ether. An example of ether creating life will first become apparent when players look to begin their civilian workforce. Ether will be required to form and breathe life into player-owned civilians and other biological life forms planned for future release inside of Earth 2. But be careful, players who create more life than what they can house or support will run the risk of having their civilians lured and converted to serve other players. In exciting news, our team has been exploring with avatars moving around inside of these virtual city spaces in first and third person view. We are researching solutions that will allow these avatars to navigate all over E2V1 in a multitude of ways, which will include entering buildings and navigating to different virtual room spaces inside of these buildings and much more. These avatars will be customizable. This marks the end of our first vlog series consisting of vlogs one to eight. It's been a pleasure to share some of our progress with you via these vlogs. The Earth2 team has an extremely busy schedule of building and delivering products throughout the second half of 2022, and we anticipate a gap between our next vlog series. The next significant footage we showcase of E2V1 will be released in close proximity to the Essence token trading live. This scheduled footage will introduce, show, and prove a number of things inside our vast and open digital Earth. It will be a great addition to build excitement toward the launch of the Earth 2 Essence token and a glimpse at some of the possibilities we're aiming to introduce on E2V1 and beyond. In the meantime, the Earth2 team will continue to work toward the release of E2V1 and supporting features to provide more utility to Essence and more things for players to do inside of Earth 2. We thank you for joining us during this vlog series and look forward to showing you more exciting Earth-2 developments in the near future.

Page 1 of 1 Generated with Discrub Shane 01/07/2024 at 10:04:12 EST anyway, I need to get to bed guys. Hope some of the answers above were of interest but mainly I just wanted to confirm support will help look after any cases and reach out the Community Manager if there are further issues. Night everyone Shane 01/07/2024 at 10:03:02 EST sorry, I won't be sharing any further hints right now. Someone will work it out one day Shane 01/07/2024 at 10:02:42 EST For most I think the wait is not very long. We just receive random flags from our banking partners and need to provide further details. It's not easy setting up all of these banking relationships for digital goods, a damn headache for our accounting staff a lot of the time but I believe it's worth it for the long run Shane 01/07/2024 at 10:00:57 EST hi there. That is a very creative answer, you have an amazing mind. Unfortunately it's not the answer though. But good luck for next time! Shane 01/07/2024 at 10:00:18 EST I need to check the dates, but will review it when I learn about those details. The next 3 months for me are not very pretty .. a lot to do Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:59:39 EST no further thoughts really. Just watching to see how things progress Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:58:44 EST please read my message carefully. There is not really a point to repeat it. As I said, we have nothing further to share right now but I can confirm that we're very confident that no sensitive customer data was leaked. If you were genuinely concerned, you would be happy to hear that Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:56:45 EST Thanks Drew, much appreciated. But oh yeah .. some still claim that e2 is ded 🙂 We make one friendly reminder announcement and sell almost 300K tiles in minutes .. to be honest I didn't see that coming though. Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:54:54 EST I don't really have any thoughts yet. I read up on it as many others did and am not certain what it means yet - I guess they will release further details when they're ready. If they release something cool then great, the Metaverse doesn't have a great name right now so anything giving it a better name is a good thing, however, we'll have to wait and see. I remember the backlash we received on YouTube for even referencing Ready Play One to give context about what a Metaverse is .. now we have a project claiming they are releasing Ready Player One, this year no less .. so I wonder if they will receive the same attention on YouTube or whether that was just something reserved for Earth 2. Anyway, I will be interested to see what they launch this year, if it ends up being something good then at least it's a +1 for the Metaverse name, will have to wait and see Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:49:49 EST do we need to explain why something was announced? I believe it was just a friendly reminder. Maybe there will be more. Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:47:21 EST please refer to the message I shared the other day, we have nothing further to share right now. What I can say, as I did the other day, is that we are very sure that no sensitive customer data was leaked or at risk, so rest assured there is no need to change passwords, or 2FA etc etc. If that were the case, we would have announced something urgently. 09:44:48 is 1am here now and I am about to call it a night, I just heard about this and dropped in to offer an apology on behalf of Earth 2. We certainly didn't expect the sudden rush and selling almost 300K tiles in minutes. Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:43:09 EST we have capable people overlooking support, I am sure our team will work out a reasonable solution. Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:42:24 EST exactly as the Community Manager has noted, and I may also add we sincerely apologise to all of those who experienced an overlapping issue. We did not expect this much of a sudden rush with almost 300K tiles selling in minutes. Apologies for this, I know it's frustrating to have to submit a support ticket but as the Community Manager pointed out, Support will look after anyone with an issue. Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:39:34 EST that's exactly what I was going to point out. You beat me to it. I am sure support will check the time stamp to ascertain who purchased first Shane 01/07/2024 at 09:38:37 EST hi hippo. Thanks for the observation. Just pointing out that E2V1 is completely different tech and completely different servers, having said that, I am sure there will be growing pains. Shane 01/04/2024 at 08:21:54 EST hi Everyone. Hope you're all doing well. I just want to briefly address that we are aware of rumours regarding part of our website source code allegedly being uploaded by someone online. We are yet to confirm this, but based on what we have seen so far, even if the rumours turn out to be correct, we are very confident that no sensitive customer information has been compromised. This has taken up the majority of the day for a number of our staff, including myself and a number of senior devs involved in reviewing various screenshots shared online, amongst other things, as we take these rumours very seriously and spend time investigating their veracity. We cannot locate the source of where the alleged files were uploaded, so if anyone has any information to share so we can take a closer look, please do reach out to info@earth2.io - we'd really appreciate any further details. We have prepared a statement which is being reviewed. It is almost midnight here now so if the statement needs to be released it won't be until tomorrow morning our local time. The most important thing right now and the reason I am taking time to write this message is that we are very confident that this is not a leak of sensitive customer data and the statement will explain why. Hope you all have a good day or evening ahead. Shane 12/30/2023 at 12:38:50 EST anyway, I don't want to miss the sunrise so cannot stop to chat. 3:40am now and I need to drive about 40 mins to get there. Need to pack the car. Bye all Shane 12/30/2023 at 12:36:37 EST as mentioned numerous times in this chat, we are spreading awareness. I am happy people are subbing, that's a good result for now. Just because someone sees a video they like doesn't mean they are going to jump on and spend money. They like what they see, then sub'd - great 12:32:11 is 3:30am here and I promised my son I'd take him fishing so just about to leave. Hope you all have a good day and enjoy seeing in the new year Shane 12/30/2023 at 12:31:41 EST thank you and to you Shane 12/30/2023 at 12:31:27 EST right, but I find it odd that some would want to pursue it so actively after we have clearly confirmed what we are doing and why the results are there. I am not even sure why we needed to explain all the details, I am not sure other projects explain in detail when, why and how they are running awareness campaigns. Anyway, it is was it is - maybe I will slow the awareness campaign down a bit into the new year so people can feel more at ease and stop being disappointed that the subs + views are going up Shane 12/30/2023 at 12:28:13 EST we are spreading awareness. It's been stated numerous times. We have had some really good success via YT as well. I mentioned a number of times we are testing various social channels. Perhaps just enjoy it? The fact people see the clips and decide to sub is great, it means next time when we want to promote say game play, or other progress, there will be a larger audience who has already heard about E2. I don't understand what people expect to gain from continuously bringing up a subject of 'things not adding up' or 'it's all fake'. We've explained that it's not, we explained why it's not and what we are doing, yet people still try to push this. I am curious what they expect to gain from it.

and decide to sub is great, it means next time when we want to promote say game play, or other progress, there will be a larger audience who has already heard about E2. I don't understand what people expect to gain from continuously bringing up a subject of 'things not adding up' or 'it's all fake'. We've explained that it's not, we explained why it's not and what we are doing, yet people still try to push this. I am curious what they expect to gain from it. They want E2 to be successful but happily push type of thing time and time again - what benefit does it brng them? As I mentioned, just enjoy the fact that people like to clip enough to sub, that's where my head is at and it's good to see some results from a fairly small awareness campaign. I am really suprised at the subs as I mentioned before, it's a good thing not a bad thing Shane 12/30/2023 at 12:22:40 EST this is exactly right, we / I myself have made so many statements reaffirming it that it's diffcult to believe people still have an issue with it Shane 12/25/2023 at 11:19:54 EST thank you - and Merry Christmas to you too. Hope you all enjoy the rest of it wherever you are in the world. Keep safe! 11:19:12 Merry Christmas everyone. Hope you all had a safe and memorable day with family and loved ones 🎄 Shane 12/23/2023 at 06:47:50 EST now please, let me go buy some skins lol Shane 12/23/2023 at 06:46:48 EST 100% agree. Just lodge a ticket to support for a refund and they will check it out for you. So just to be clear, if you didn't notice the price on checkout and purchased in the first few minutes before the listed page price was updated, then just create a ticket and support will deal with it for you. This was a UI issue because of an admin setting, it was fixed within a few minutes when we realised but we take responsibility and if you purchased a skin in the first few minutes when the display issue was there then you will get a refund and your skins will go back into the supply pool - no problem. It's a pity this happened as our team spent quite some time designing and modelling these items to be game ready, but we did fix it within a couple of minutes. Anyway, for those who like the skins then please enjoy. 06:41:29 06:41:03 sorry there was a mistake with the admin settings, however, on checkout it did show actual price before buying. Having said that, if anyone who purchased before in the first few minutes before the issue was resolved wants a refund then just email support. They will check the time of purchase and process the refund for you. Any that are refunded will go back into the supply pool for others to purchase at a later date. Just be mindful our support is limited over the break so may not be refunded until they fully return. Shane 12/21/2023 at 12:19:24 EST I have given up on Christmas this year, I told my family we might have to celebrate it late just too much work to be done Shane 12/21/2023 at 12:18:28 EST the CM is just following guidelines. Blame the guidelines (which we agreed to internally as a team), not the CM Shane 12/21/2023 at 12:17:30 EST I just checked up on the conversation above and can see multiple comments targeted at the CM for doing their job. Like this comment and many others. I am surprised she didn't give you a time out behaving like that. You should probably appreciate the fact she didn't yet you're in here continuing on with it. What message does that send to the CM? To me it sends a message that letting the situation settle down does not work, some people just continue on 12:12:23 seriously, the time some people have for this much drama Shane 12/21/2023 at 12:11:59 EST not without reason Shanewe are doing this too, but when I see a team member struggling or being treated unfairly I feel obliged to jump in. Maybe it's a trait I need to reconsider, but it's just part of who I am .. if I see people in trouble I will usually try to help them. Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:45:16 EST I feel silly recounting that story now and I shouldn't have referenced it or brought it up so I edited it out. Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:39:23 EST anyway, I am off sorry. Has been a long day. Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:37:59 EST we are doing this too, but when I see a team member struggling or being treated unfairly I feel obliged to jump in. Maybe it's a trait I need to reconsider, but it's just part of who I am .. if I see people in trouble I will usually try to help them. 12:33:42 Have been so busy I just realised I lost my Supercharged E-ther Boost 🤦 Great .. Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:21:15 EST this is exactly right. The CM gets little time from me but I am in the group channel on slack where the CM reports + shares messages she plans to post etc. I saw the message she planned to post and I thought it looked like a reasonable message, then I hear about people getting upset because of a few words. I wanted to see for myself .. and saw the same people trying to undermine the CM. It's tiresome 12:18:23 also before people start, we have paid all the rights for the song we used to BGM and the various publishers (4 of them in total!). We need to get the copyright removed so ads stop running but it's not super high on the agenda 12:16:39 anyway, just respect the requests from the CM or mods please. This is all a waste of valuable time and energy which could be easily avoided. For example, I received a report on someone in here earlier today saying the dislike ratio on our new video was 1.9K dislikes or something. We cannot be expected to provide evidence on every little accusation like this, but if we don't then people believe it .. so what can we do apart from ask people to please cease pushing misinformation. It's too time consuming to be fetching data to prove every little lie coming from these people as wrong. I mean here is our like / dislike ratio. Directly from YouTube - yet we have people in here claiming the complete opposite. It's tiresome LikesRatio.png 44.2KB Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:11:01 EST we will be saving the gameplay footage for some bigger events next year. I provided more details around this the other day I believe. So yes, it's not abandoned by any means Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:03:21 EST that would be great if mods could please keep across this Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:02:11 EST we 'shouldn't' need to respond, but unfortunately based on the reports I receive if we don't respond they just keep on with it and before we know it a few people in our own discord are pushing these absurd notions left right and centre Shane 12/19/2023 at 12:00:29 EST another ridiculous comment. Do you know what marketing campaign we are running? What our focus is? What we are testing? We have a plan, just let us get on with it. Just because you don't see new people in here asking you to hold their hand doesn't mean we are not achieving our goals. Please 11:59:06 just be happy people actually like WATCHING the video and decided to SUB! 11:58:05 it's getting tiresome to be honest, these reports I receive are just ridiculous sometimes and people refuse to respect warnings or polite requests. Look at this latest thing with the video. - other projects / youtubers buy fake views, subs (etc) fake comments etc etc, nobody bats an eyelid, yeah it's just normal who cares - Earth 2 runs a legitimate awareness campaign, 100% legal and absolutely normal and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE! FAKE! WEIRD! SOMETHING IS WRONG! NOTHING IS ADDING UP! LOOK! A COMMENT FROM A BOY WHO ONLY HAS A FEW VIDEOS ON HIS ACCOUNT! LOOK! SOME NEGATIVE LIKES ON A FACEBOOK POST! SUPER WEIRD SOMETHING IS GOING ON! And even if we spend the time to nicely explain what we are doing, it continues. It gets tiresome guys, really tiresome and is a complete waste of time on something that should not even be an issue Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:52:36 EST EXACTLY!

LIKES ON A FACEBOOK POST! SUPER WEIRD SOMETHING IS GOING ON! And even if we spend the time to nicely explain what we are doing, it continues. It gets tiresome guys, really tiresome and is a complete waste of time on something that should not even be an issue Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:52:36 EST EXACTLY! Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:49:49 EST EXACTLY Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:46:17 EST exactly Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:45:15 EST and I have not provided information explaining the results? If you don't want to believe it, fine, no problem. But the CM has asked people to stop pushing these weird notions of everything being fake so at least respect that and keep it to yourself Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:42:58 EST it was all fake, there were some negative likes Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:42:35 EST not wondering, suggesting why Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:42:06 EST I don't even know what you are referring to with regards to these negative likes, but yes, by all means, let's focus on some negative likes and ignore the fact the channel has over 100K followers and 300K + views on the video. It was not worth it because there were a few negative likes 11:40:00 is anyone here? Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:39:57 EST are you working as part of our marketing team? Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:38:04 EST my goodness .. 11:37:34 just a COMPLETE waste of TIME and ENERGY Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:37:23 EST I agree with this. Shane 12/19/2023 at 11:36:21 EST more like trying to associate everything as being fake because of a few fb likes Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:32:07 EST just message CM with details. There are too many different reasons it could be. If you've withdrawn multiple times our banking partners can even flag and ask us to review 17:30:46 anyway, I am out. I have a big day today. Keep safe and please, consider letting us just test these awareness campaigns and enjoy the fact some are deciding to watch the video and sub. I am really pleasantly surprised on the sub count increase, did not expect that at all. Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:28:06 EST I can only imagine.. I have heard we still receive daily comments on YouTube accusing us of being a scam due to the accusatory driven videos published about us in the past. It all gets recorded and documented. Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:25:31 EST ok will check it out, thanks Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:25:05 EST sorry, it wouldn't be right to comment on that. They are head of a stock exchange listed company and I will treat those discussions privately for now Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:22:48 EST no comment Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:22:05 EST thanks Zenderman - really appreciate the comment 🙏 Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:21:07 EST thanks Drew, much appreciated. Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:20:13 EST no it's work related, not holidays. I doubt I will get a chance for a break this year .. hoping for maybe 1 week early Jan but nothing planned and even that is not looking possible. I want to use the downtime over the holiday break to try and catch up on things I can't get to due to my other daily distractions I get Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:18:07 EST oh I see, you mean the current video. Yes possibly if we keep the campaigns running but I am not sure whether I will or if so for how long Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:17:19 EST it's not a super hype video, I said it's laid back and enjoyable I feel Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:16:32 EST no. I am flying today and will be part of my schedule but does not mean anything yet and as I said, there are many things to consider here and I want to get the adjustments right which will be beneficial for every Essence holder. Please see my previous messages on this topic. Shane 12/17/2023 at 17:12:43 EST so let me get this right. You're now saying everything is fake because a boy who only has a few videos on his YouTube profile commented. These are some pretty harsh rules being applied to Earth 2 here .. why are people so focused on trying to find anything to make it fake? I am genuinely curious. You do realise that most people with a YouTube account never upload a single video and rarely have any visual information about themselves. It's very common on YouTube yet you're here saying everything is unfortunately fake because a boy with only a few videos commented. These are some very harsh double standard rules being applied to e2 here .. just let us get on with our job please. I could probably find thousands of comments under any big youtube channel and locate comments from people who have no info on their profile. Shane 12/17/2023 at 15:40:09 EST I have answered the question you asked probably more than 10 times over the past 2 months on Discord and Twitter. Absurd you say I'm avoiding it because I don't answer you Shane 12/17/2023 at 15:39:25 EST well it's a result of a campaign we are testing. But much higher interest than we had on the video from last year so that's a good sign Shane 12/17/2023 at 15:38:25 EST I am only posting the message above, if I write anything further that message is forgotten. Focus on the message above and let it sink in please. 15:37:21 hey guys. I can't be in here 24/7 repeating the same statement over and over. I have already commented numerous times that we are running some awareness campaigns on various socials. If you must know, we tested the exact same thing with video from Dec 2022 and nobody said a word. Why? Probably because the interest and engagement was not this high. This new footage IS getting better results which IS a good thing. Let's just leave it now please, it looks terrible having e2 community members in here carrying on about it being fake, someone else buying fake views, subs (I am also very surprised about the subs .. we have not pushed any campaigns to focus on increasing subs, just awareness) after we have confirmed on numerous occasions that we are pushing an awareness campaign and the results are in line with that campaign. Also I heard YouTube don't tend to run ads on 'fake' views, it would destroy their whole business model for advertisers and copyright owners alike. I just saw an ad for Kung Fu Panda 4 on the latest e2 video. Doubt they would be pushing those premium ads on fake views. That aside, I will just copy paste what I wrote above again because surely someone will ignore it and carry on with the fake view narrative. > I can't be in here 24/7 repeating the same statement over and over.

This is one area I am receiving significant legal advice around Shane 12/17/2023 at 06:16:39 EST I am not confirming one way or the other I'm sorry Shane 12/17/2023 at 06:15:51 EST we have a lot planned but I am not going to say what or give dates I'm sorry. Let's just let things happen. But we have a lot planned for Q1 and Q2 moving into a new era for E2 Shane 12/17/2023 at 06:14:44 EST bull markets don't last a few weeks. You're seeing a bit of movement but let's just say it was the start of the bull market, for a second let's say this was the case, it should continue on for some time.

EST bull markets don't last a few weeks. You're seeing a bit of movement but let's just say it was the start of the bull market, for a second let's say this was the case, it should continue on for some time. Anyway, I am trying to make adjustments to benefit the Players significantly so please don't say after 2 years I need to delay solely due to legal advice 06:11:29 I am not able to stay and chat, I just popped in and saw that message so wanted to clear up that incorrect summary on what I wrote earlier today Shane 12/17/2023 at 06:09:48 EST it's not only due to legal advice. Please re-read my messages carefully instead of picking out one part. I was very clear that the changes I want to make will be extremely beneficial for every Essence token holder. You and others will see what I mean when the details are revealed. I suggest not to get upset about it until you see what the changes are, you'll be doing so at your own unnecessary detriment. ShaneI really need to get back to work, but I will try to answer a few more questions. Nothing past here though Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:37:45 EST ok I caught up finally! All this time was just in order to catch up to where I left this message ! I hope the answers provided some insight for some of you and hope you all have a good weekend ahead Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:36:54 EST and they already make too much money to even care. Why would you change a business model that already makes you billions a year? Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:36:30 EST those type of opportunities will come once the token has launched Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:35:49 EST yeah we did. He has been great so far! From the States Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:35:18 EST thank you! Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:35:09 EST could / if .. such big words. I agree with a cautious approach but living by those words would ensure nobody tries anything new Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:34:07 EST those arguments will not have a leg to stand on next year... they will of course start complaining about something else. The MOON IS NOT A CIRCLE! SCAMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:33:01 EST our goal is big, if I wanted to do that it would have been a long time ago and I don't think it would have benefited us to be honest. Some projects create a small access area to play around in, but we're recreating the planet Earth .. kind of goes against our main goal. So we're aiming big, I want the first release to be the entire planet Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:31:23 EST good idea and I think that would be pretty simple. @Earth 2 Team can you make a note and ensure it's recorded for review. So long as it's simple (i.e 1 day dev time) we could probably do that Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:29:41 EST as much as I'd love to, I definitely cannot share dates on this. We are pushing hard though. Some potentially big surprises coming first half of next year but we'll see how it goes Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:28:44 EST well, we're doing the best we can with the support we have and we've shown we're committed and making good progress for a small team. Given the history of these well established global corporations, I doubt anyone user on their platforms would get anywhere near the opportunity they would on ours. They don't need it .. they can dictate the terms and they do. I think there will always be an attraction to a Metaverse that shares in the success, but it takes money to build these things and this tech, it doesn't just happen. So every time you buy tiles, or a skin, or something from the Bazaar, or trade, it's helping us build and expand and we try the best we can to return that favour by trying to incorporate products that help our Players to earn something as we build the foundations for this world Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:23:46 EST no I mean E$ - this opportunity (IF IT HAPPENS) will be provided just before the Essence token officially launches Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:23:03 EST it's a great idea and certainly something we have flagged, but it's a low priority right now with focus going into other higher priority areas leading up to bigger releases Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:22:02 EST we have a script waiting to air drop locked countries ready to execute when the time is right + the historic claims will also be finalised. I can not give you an exact date I'm sorry but I can say there will be a form of refund on the Essence staked etc and I think it will be more than fair 17:19:15 I have to find where I was up to now with the questions from before I said \"no more questions from here\" Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:18:20 EST of course we plan to expand. I believe I've commented on this many times in the past Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:17:56 EST please read my messages above carefully. I have provided a clear reason why. It WILL work out a lot more beneficial for every Essence holder for us to get this right. Or I could just release now with 5B supply and miss all the addition adjustments I want to make which will benefit every Essence holder .. Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:16:26 EST I said I am not committing to a date 17:16:08 this is another sad thing I see from people who benefitted a lot from e2 .. they even write things like \"I made 10x on Earth 2, it's a scam\". I mean you have to question the mentality of some of these people who benefited so much from a project, then go out of their way spending time to try and badmouth it publicly.. must have some really messed up lives Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:14:19 EST it's a big IF on the thing I have in mind anyway, I need to make sure my plans are ok first. But if what I am thinking does move ahead you may qualify in another area .. but having said that, of course we want to provide some opportunities for our biggest supporters and believers in the project, those who sold out or profited so far have for the most part already been pretty well rewarded Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:12:16 EST sorry I really don't get time to read messages. It is busy enough internally for me every day with work and the team.. I rarely work less than a 16 hour day and if I spent time checking my messages I'd never get anything done. Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:09:49 EST I think that's always been part of the decision people make. I guess the details in the WP will begin to give you some indication on whether you were right or wrong 17:08:06 I really need to get back to work, but I will try to answer a few more questions. Nothing past here though Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:07:30 EST yes we did - we have a lot more which we haven't shown yet. But again, as I mentioned above, there are better times to show things which benefit the project and the community much more Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:06:50 EST I have a very specific system in mind. I think I have mentioned in the past that I want Players to populate the world with life, so the initial Chapter 1 will be the beggining of that where Players can find and collect life forms which can later be sythensised (in a later chapter). Chapter 1 will already have a lot to it, especially for a relatively small team, so I have a vision of steps in which these things will roll out. Regarding the pet thing .. I am not saying anything just yet. Maybe you're lucky enough to find a very rare T-Rex, you keep it (as opposed to maybe cooking it?), and in the future when you synthesise it you have no idea what might happen .. perhaps it will eat you or will love you. I guess Players will have to find out Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:03:40 EST that is the game play trailer / teaser. Again, you might get a tease but as I mentioned the other day, I would much rather save that footage for a bigger event. We have certainly shown the progress on E2V1 and shown some of what we've been working on, and I think most were pretty pleased / surprised for the most part on how far we've come with a small team in just year. But think about it, should we drop intriguing game play footage just for the sake of it or should we leave it for a bigger even next year to gain better awareness.

I mentioned the other day, I would much rather save that footage for a bigger event. We have certainly shown the progress on E2V1 and shown some of what we've been working on, and I think most were pretty pleased / surprised for the most part on how far we've come with a small team in just year. But think about it, should we drop intriguing game play footage just for the sake of it or should we leave it for a bigger even next year to gain better awareness. These are things I need to consider. Shane 12/16/2023 at 17:00:50 EST I am very picky about these things .. I want minimalistic, informative and beautiful .. you don't want to be designing for me .. Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:59:22 EST I am not committing to anything as I mentioned above, we are working on a number of things, the team is working extremely hard and I don't want to push them too much. We're constantly pushing hard for the next thing, we also need some time to recharge, it's been a big year Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:58:07 EST no, it's just a chill audio. But it fits the scenery Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:57:30 EST well that is one thing I am looking at, providing some opportunities for Players with the most tiles, most Essence, best Raiders, Diamond hands (no withdrawals) and a few others .. it may be a progressive thing, so if one group don't take up on the opportunity it moves to the next group OR maybe all get the same opportunity at the same time. But that's what I am saying, there are a few adjustments I'm working on (not only this one but other adjustments that will benefit every Essence holder) so just want work through them and get them right Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:54:42 EST yes there will be at least one more video this month, I mentioned the other day there is a longer more chill video .. I love watching it. Does not really say a lot, but more reminders on how vast and beautiful E2V1 is Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:53:31 EST please see that answer above. I kind of mixed it all into one response as I was typing Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:52:08 EST I am not sure off the top of my head. Also I have some work to get back to which I really need to focus on. Lawyers offices are shutting down this week and I want to get some final advice on a few things before that happens so I can reassess our position on the WP release. I am still not saying it will be released this month but what I can say is the adjustments being made a very favourable to anyone holding Essence so I want be sure we get it right, it's as sound as it can be from a legal perspective etc. So just give us some space because the adjustments being made will work out much better for any Essence holders in the long run. Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:48:01 EST you may not see any for a while, even after the token is launched. But I imagine there will be a constant rush to get as much as possible once the details are released so enjoy the lower competition for now Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:45:34 EST quick! Grab it! 16:43:00 ok we seem to have fixed the issue with the server for now. The site should be working optimally. One note though is that we have termporarily removed the Mentar icon for the property being actively Raided. This is only a temporary thing but just want people to be aware. We will look at reactivating the Mentar icon as soon as we can, but given tomorrow is a Sunday for most of our dev team it may or may not happen tomorrow or Monday. So just be aware, properties you're actively raiding will not have the little Mentar icon next to them for now. Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:04:24 EST I am going to jump back to team chat now on the website issue. We may have a short term fix, have identified one very specific area in raiding where an optimised query was overlooked but I will provide more details once we've deployed and tested the theory Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:03:20 EST definitely surprises, I did not expect the order of releases at all Shane 12/16/2023 at 16:02:46 EST it was designed to work the way it works .. if we keep watering things down then what? We give everyone a chance to vote their own Territory and win their own prize? Of course I thought there would be other openings much earlier, but there weren't - completely unexpected but that's what the biggest group of votes have determined. It just seems some are working together better than others and if you look at the total number of votes winning the releases they only make up a fraction of the circulating suppy of Essence .. so it's asking to change a set of rules because one group is collaborating too well and I don't think that's a good reason to change things Shane 12/16/2023 at 15:59:32 EST all good thanks. I just dropped in to update on the server / website issue. Am going to go back and keep working on it with the team 15:57:30 enough of that thanks. Many Koreans would find that comment offensive @Crazy Dev . Groups are playing within the rules for voting on T3 Territories, if you want to change that then work better as a group like other groups are, don't ask for the rules to be changed to make it easier for you. (Oh I can see the message was already deleted .. no more comments like that, is not acceptable) I just dropped in to say we are aware of the current issue on the server and are working on a solution to hopefully resolve the problem for now. Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:32:30 EST what in the world is this .. lol Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:31:56 EST then please stand up 01:31:38 anyway, I need to get going. Hope you all have a good day ahead and enjoy the weekend 01:30:50 we have quite a few things moving behind the scenes for next year, there are some key points releasing game play footage would be a much wiser move for publicity and celebrating certain events. If that is the case, I still have another 7 min video I can drop, nice relaxing one that just casually celebrates how awesome E2V1 actually is .. less rushed Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:28:59 EST perhaps .. Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:28:45 EST it is mainly aim at keeping our own Players updated .. remember we have quite a lot Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:27:29 EST we are contemplating a few things right now regarding the second video. Maybe more footage of E2V1 and save the game play leading up to a bigger stage to get a lot more attention / publicity from it .. we might show a short teaser. There are many things going on behind the scenes right now, I don't have a clear answer I'm sorry. 01:24:32 anyway, I have to get going, just wanted to clarify the above. And again, cannot trust that 3rd party software, very odd results there Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:23:55 EST we're just testing a few things. Seeing what type of reach we can get, setting audiences etc. We will test other platforms too Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:23:07 EST I guess not everyone is logged into their youtube account. I watch many videos without logging in and almost never leave a comment. You see some videos with 10 million views and 3K comments or less .. not out of place 01:21:51 the above screenshot is directly from YouTube 01:21:10 so the 3rd party software is completely messed up if you're saying you just watched it go from 30K to 80K in a couple of hours 01:20:44 there is about 20K views in the past 24 hours 01:20:35 so today is on the right side 01:20:12 @Drew that is the last 48 hours. It looks like it just spiked when some awareness campaigns were running. As Mr Green said, if they are bots or fake views or whatever, youtube would notify us and remove them. Anyway, I have provided an explanation when I don't really have to but it's odd seeing these arguments in here against one another because the video is getting more views last48hours.png 7.93KB Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:16:27 EST then YouTube is wrong and the third party software is right 01:15:52 I can see in YouTube it was around 20K for the entire day during an awareness campaign.

an explanation when I don't really have to but it's odd seeing these arguments in here against one another because the video is getting more views last48hours.png 7.93KB Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:16:27 EST then YouTube is wrong and the third party software is right 01:15:52 I can see in YouTube it was around 20K for the entire day during an awareness campaign. The fact people click through and watch some is good Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:15:11 EST it wasn't 50K views in a few hours .. no idea where this even came from ? Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:14:51 EST I already checked Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:14:44 EST it's from facebook. I can't really say much more than that Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:13:36 EST I saw it, when a big company like FB run ads they hit hundreds of thousands in a short period of time. Also 3rd party programs are not the most reliable 01:12:49 and from what I see it was around 19K views today. Nothing too spectacular Shane 12/15/2023 at 01:12:04 EST yes it seems this is the reason. We're just running an awareness campaign on FB. Hope this will put all the arguments to rest Shane 12/10/2023 at 12:30:42 EST heads up that we've just fixed the issue some were having when slotting their jewels. Should be live and fully deployed to prod now. Really appreciate our devs + QA + devops jumping on this on a Sunday to get the issue resolved. Shane 12/10/2023 at 06:15:30 EST good thanks. I can't stick around to chat sorry, I am busy on a few things but just wanted to provide the above thoughts as I know a few others (no Seike) have been in here trying to draw focus on this new game. Hope you all enjoy your weekend 06:13:18 Another positive I take from all of this is that people are super interested in massive open worlds to explore and play in, so once we release E2V1 and continue building on it over coming years I am confident people will be interested in jumping in, I mean look at the response on this video with a little game play teasers and it's not even our real Earth! As I said, the only thing that really got me was the specific focus on \"Earth\" in the trailer, it's a very powerful claim and from my experience you'd better be willing to back it up, or maybe the YouTubers will go easy on them because they're not \"Earth 2\". (Screenshot above - this is what I mean about vast long view distances, it has a profound effect on how 'everything' feels when you can see as far as the horizon.. much like the beautiful world we live in) Shane 12/10/2023 at 06:13:06 EST yes I saw this trailer too and first I would point out that any game development with massive worlds is very cool, in fact I just find any game development cool if they are focused on delivering an interesting product that people enjoy using, after all, that's the bottom line, creating something that people enjoy spending time on. I realise Earth 2 does not have that mass appeal yet, but we have tried to build in a way that provides something to do for those who want to be hands on in the lead up to E2V1 and beyond and there are people who enjoy that aspect. For those in here trying to draw a comparison here to Earth 2 (which is obviously why I am even responding here), you have to remember this game has been built on an engine they have been working on for over 13 years and on top of that has had a dedicated team working specifically on Light No Fire (without external pressure) for 5 years. If anything, this shows how complicated the tech is and how impressive E2V1 is over such a short period of time. Even taking some of these things into consideration after watching the trailer I had a couple of thoughts: 1 - I was curious why they kept saying Earth as opposed to Earth-size as the main point of focus at the beginning of the video. Those words used there sets precedence for the remaining pay of the video and makes it more exciting, but the thing is, the game world they are making is not at all even on Earth. Creating a procedural world the size of Earth vs creating the actual Earth are two very different things, one is a lot easier than the other. When any reasonable person sees Earth they would think of the beautiful planet we live on, I mean you look at the definition of Earth and it's \"the planet on which we live on\". So it's curious how they specifically referred to it being Earth in the video; A MULTIPLAYER EARTH A PROCEDURAL EARTH A FANTASY EARTH AN UNEXPLORED EARTH With 'EARTH' remaining visible at all times as the core focus point when even themselves they admit in the small print that it's just Earth-sized. We claimed to be creating a digital Earth and we had to based it on Earth and I think if we advertised our world is Earth and it turned out not to be Earth, there would no doubt be a group of YouTubers calling us out on that.. I wonder if the same level of critique will be applied here because obviously it's a massive selling point and is the first major point the video focuses on with EARTH being visible for the first 13 seconds. 2 - Another thing I felt is why the footage feels a bit restricted somehow, like not open, clear and vast, especially when I compare my experience inside E2V1 or even what anyone can see from the footage we have released last year and this year. 3 - When the dragon flies up over the mountain ridge (very cool!) I noticed they moved the camera angle down very quickly, so I wondered why they did this and went back to pause. I noticed the distant view looks empty / no formation or terrain, and that might be the reason they put white clouds there to obscure the view. Another reason might also be to hide the view distance of the massive boulders which were popping in at relatively close distance. Anyway, I'm not going to dive into comparisons with E2V1, there are many, but what I'd prefer to focus on is that at the end of the day it's a very cool video and though I'm not sure how far away we are from having dragon mounts, it's good to see someone like Sean Murray come back from being heavily criticised on No Man's Sky in the past, a heavily ambitious project, receiving death threats (I know what that's like) and turn things around to keep building, a really good result for him and their studio at the end of the day which is awesome to see! E2V1Snap.png 3.82MB Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:12:03 EST anyway, I need to do something presently so have to head off. Enjoy the day Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:11:42 EST pretty sure we have them, there were many we have not not showcased in that footage Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:11:15 EST would be very well drafted 2D drawings. The more angles / detail the better. We may also accept 3D models too Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:10:48 EST I didn't say you can't see flags, you can see flags in E2V1 and you can see the flags at MUCH greater view distances that on the website. So we're definitely not getting rid of tile art. You've seen the screenshots I shared in the past I'm sure Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:09:38 EST yeah I am very excited about that aspect ! It rewards artists and creative people, from the community, which is something I believe strongly in. Want a good pirate character or knight ? Come up with a kick ass design, get some votes and our team will review it! Just a note though, does not mean we can / will accept every winning vote, there may be reasons we cannot create some Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:07:53 EST will do thank you Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:07:39 EST heatmaps are not high priority, I have explained previously that they will not be part of E2V1 so they have been a low priority to maintain on the website. Bottom line is probably not to expect it fixed, we're looking toward E2V1 Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:05:43 EST this is incorrect. I have explained above and in the announcement text that is was due to the article being released later than expected due to things getting busy last night.

so they have been a low priority to maintain on the website. Bottom line is probably not to expect it fixed, we're looking toward E2V1 Shane 12/03/2023 at 06:05:43 EST this is incorrect. I have explained above and in the announcement text that is was due to the article being released later than expected due to things getting busy last night. It was extended for a few hours, and will never happen again on future drops unless there is a technical difficulty or something Shane 12/03/2023 at 01:31:09 EST ok I need to get going now, such a crazy day and still going full speed ahead .. hope you all enjoy your Sunday 01:30:16 hey guys - just a couple quick points. I've not caught up on chat still working on things and too much to read (I might try and stream reading through and responding to comments if anyone interested in that? Might be easier than replying and I can probably share more). Anyway, few quick points - yes there are 30K, 5K of those earnable in game. I am not looking at now I'm looking into the future. Sure 30K sounds like a lot now, but even with a few hundred thousand players (which we already have registered) it starts looking more scarce, and then throw in potential millions of Players over the years and starts looking very rare even at 30K .. you know some of these larger games put no limit on their skins (cannot be sold p2p anyway) and there are still Players wanting them, trying to work out when they will even be available to purchase again (and we're not even talking about gacha here ..). - so sure, 30K but they will never be discounted again and that number might not seem so high in the future - also as I tweeted on X just a couple of hours ago (don't hold me to it!!!) but I want Players to be able to group a few of their avatars and explore together, so you know .. camp sites, explore, rest etc. Sure you might need to come up with more food water, but I want it to be a group system and if we can (LONG TERM) introduce AI (preferably player influenced!) then that would be cool too. So potentially you could have Kyung as part of your group when exploring. Now it's too early to confirm all of this but just letting you know what I am thinking and envisioning. - lastly, just quickly, we were supposed to release the Earth 2 Skin store article much earlier to give Players a better understanding on how the system works before the timer started, but there were a few last minute things and we didn't get to it. Therefore I extended the time. Actually it's worse for Earth 2 for the timer to be extended as it means more discounted sales as opposed to full price sales as only full price will ever be available when she goes on sale in the future Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:27:05 EST let's just enjoy this one for now lol. Ok I am really off! I think I can finally sleep in peace for one night now this is released! I just need to settle down too much excitement .. argh. Bye all! Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:26:10 EST Fish. Fish. Fish Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:24:12 EST we want to sell more than 3 Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:23:16 EST I don't usually do this type of thing .. but eh image_737.png 138KB Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:20:16 EST I am not confirming sorry, but search my chat history I have touched on it Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:19:55 EST just clarifying, I wasn't pointing a finger at you with regards to my comment by any means 08:18:48 I'm out - night everyone Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:18:41 EST yes, I didn't say we're not and I certainly didn't say I don't have a plan. I would prefer to grow slow and organically with the RIGHT TOKEN HOLDERS than to go haywire and pump and dump our precious Essence Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:17:52 EST wait and see Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:17:44 EST yeah we will have that type of opportunity. Of course we want people uploading beautiful footage 08:17:13 anyway, I am pretty exhausted guys, so many question and I wish I could answer them all. I think maybe a Q and A soon when things settle a bit will be easier, then I can just answer without typing it all out. You imagine being in a chat room with 30 people asking questions then trying to answer them all lol .. I mean I love it but I feel bad that I can't answer all the questions and sit here typing like a mad man ! Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:16:01 EST and where did I say we're going to be putting jaw dropping amounts of ETH in exactly? I know we were successful but we're not Microsoft or Google guys. We've made tens of millions in revenue which is great, but we also have to pay taxes, employees and we're trying to build the beginnings of something that facebook, for example, is throwing billions at. Not sure where these expectations are coming from, we're doing the best we can but we need to build and expand the team to succeed. Also, the climate is shifting in Web3 / blockchain as far as legislation, compliance etc. There are rules I need to follow too. I have top law firms that advise me on what I can, can't or should / shouldn't do. I realise you'd love e2 to through buckets of ETH into a liquidity pool so you could cash out, along with thousands of others .. but where does that leave e2 and building what we've set out to build? Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:10:20 EST when did I say that? Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:09:38 EST you'll learn about this, but we will be aiming for stamina, health, hunger, thirst, body temp (maybe later) while exploring E2V1. If you die there will be consequences too .. so don't die Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:08:37 EST we will be aiming for release next year, as early as we can. Have quite a bit to get through though Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:08:09 EST yes I want to allow that, we have already tested so should be good. I just need to figure out what happens close to coast lines .. I have mentioned this before when answering others Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:07:23 EST That's cool!!! Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:07:00 EST Kyung may return at points in the future, not sure. But she will never be discounted again. That's just a celebration for today Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:06:28 EST people buy landmarks for different reasons. I still plan to have an AR aspect to E2 in the future, we're building in Unity, right? There are just higher priorities first. Also, what do you think the first thing Players are going to do inside E2V1? Maybe check what's happening in popular locations? Maybe others will make their own popular locations. There is a lot to consider Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:04:59 EST haha no Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:04:37 EST maybe others will want to be interoperable with us? But to answer your question, we're taking things one step at a time. I can see your passionate about decentralised ownership and that's fine, maybe we will have what you're looking for one day in the future Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:03:18 EST thank you. Not right now, we need to get the basics out first. These other voxel based concepts are cool, but they are small and limited (in my opinion). Sure you can build whatever you want but I wanted something that looks a bit more realistic. That means we need to make exceptions - I don't think it's an issue though. Also, need to remember we building on a world scale, not a small AAA environment that has more freedom. You see every shot in that video of E2V1? YOU CAN TRAVEL THERE. You can go to that mountain top you see in the distant horizon. It's just different goals my friend Shane 12/02/2023 at 08:00:42 EST we're building a metaverse. There should not be limitation .. dinosaurs, horses, fish, unicorns, dragons .. you know, it's a metaverse. I appreciate games have certain art styles and intentional restrictions in their game design, but we have a bit of freedom and I intend to use it Shane 12/02/2023 at 07:58:52 EST correct, I take it as compliment that you thought it was pre-rendered.

unicorns, dragons .. you know, it's a metaverse. I appreciate games have certain art styles and intentional restrictions in their game design, but we have a bit of freedom and I intend to use it Shane 12/02/2023 at 07:58:52 EST correct, I take it as compliment that you thought it was pre-rendered. It shows a lot of people are going to be shocked when we release Shane 12/02/2023 at 07:57:44 EST welcome friend. We can be enternally tired together Shane 12/02/2023 at 07:57:23 EST team is very happy, many had not seen the footage as we keep it pretty confidential until release. Quite a few even in the team were shocked which is great Shane 12/02/2023 at 07:56:28 EST I'm not sure, I just want to sleep tbh but have to wait for the adrenaline to settle down. Shane 12/02/2023 at 07:54:39 EST we will show this. If you're interested in seeing it just follow along. Thanks for your questions, but I can assure you all footage is in-game real time. I drop into E2V1 often running around, we'll be showing more as things progress Shane 12/02/2023 at 07:14:25 EST hope you guys enjoyed - a lot of effort from a small team to make that progress. Huge biome system, water across the entire planet, test of 2nd Gen Civs, new Character system .. and too many other things I cannot even think of right now Shane 12/02/2023 at 06:58:38 EST enjoy the vid guys! I am here too! Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:57:18 EST anyway, I am out guys, 6am and has been a very long night. I have some more things to wrap up so I want to focus on those before taking a nap. Keep safe and hope you all enjoy the video! I will be watching somewhere! Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:56:29 EST surely I am aiming for before, that has always been the plan Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:54:32 EST I just want to get through the next couple of weeks first, but yes I'd like to get it out this month (don't hold me to it) Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:53:35 EST I am not aware of this. I know one of our accounting staff has been away but I don't think there are big delays, but there are so many things that could trigger delays you cannot pin it onto one reason. For example, some Players might withdraw over time then when they hit a large amount we receive requests from our banking partners to check on AML, fraud, proof of wealth etc. It's fairly standard. Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:51:01 EST I took a look at some of the other instances this song was used for footage online .. and I think the way it's been moulded around out footage leaves the rest for dead. My opinion may be biased though Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:49:55 EST oddly it didn't this time for a number of hours so I thought YouTube was glitching but no, it was just delayed Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:49:16 EST I mean release one of me sleeping. I am sure it will be appeasing for all (joking of course) Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:48:27 EST I heard about that. They were told who to award the prize to for that question so they don't know the answer to the question you're asking them. If they respond telling you they are not sure, you will surely be upset. I think they were going to reply but didn't want to cause more problems as a few noisy people seem to have a good time using whatever they can against them these days. It was the first competition and things were hectic. I am sure there was a reason but the Community Manager doesn't know why and we've been too busy to chase people up and ask them to review for the sake of one answer Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:44:41 EST I think people have their own feelings and assume that everyone feels the same way. So when they convey how they feel they use words like 'everyone' and 'we all' (etc) to make it seem like everyone agrees with them. I also believe there are people in here who remain silent and have just had enough of some of the drama and just want to talk about other things Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:42:15 EST the way I have seen the Community Manager treated by some in here would not have been tolerated by our previous Community Managers if they were treated the same way. Odd that people would intentionally go out of their way to cause problems they would not normally create around the previous Community Manager and then expect to be ignored and wrapped in cotton wool Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:40:21 EST I'm sorry the two don't seem to connect, so really not sure what it's implying Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:39:46 EST you would need the right type of prospecting CDs as a first step. Not sure if there will be other requirements but that would be a bare minimum Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:39:05 EST I am not sure what \"what was the point of uploading 2 videos instead of just 1?\" is supposed to mean. We uploaded a video and set to premiere. I don't know where we stated we uploaded 2 videos Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:36:46 EST I don't know what you mean Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:36:22 EST oh sneaky little trick Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:35:35 EST plan to Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:35:27 EST later - we're not cramming everything in and remember most of this footage is from months ago (apart from some I wanted to add to give a bit of context around a few things and show a little something off) Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:34:26 EST a good pair of quality headsets will just enhance the viewing I think, not saying any more 14:33:21 I think just over 7 mins. But doesn't feel that long as it flows pretty nicely and packs in quite a lot to take in Shane 12/01/2023 at 14:32:15 EST brought a few tears down my cheeks when I saw the final version with all the little additions. Hope everyone enjoys it 14:30:34 can we stop with the pings putting the Community Manager down please? She's just doing her job. It's the first account most of you will go to and hope for help when you need it, so what is the point coming in here and tagging her with negative comments? Shane 11/30/2023 at 06:19:47 EST anyway, I am off. Sorry guys, I have a lot to do and never enough time to do it. Have a good day Shane 11/30/2023 at 06:19:03 EST it was, and now it has 2 extra minutes for a few reasons you will find out when it premieres. And I put up my hand in the discord announcement and asked for forgiveness as a gesture of me apologising. I think if I dropped in earlier and said it might be delayed without people seeing it is uploaded, ready to go would have caused more stress and disappointment until people did see it uploaded. But thanks for your feedback, just know I did consider that but weighed against doing it for the above reason Shane 11/30/2023 at 06:15:41 EST oh course there are - it's not me alone! I am just telling directing between 5-6 people. But it's a lot on top of an already busy schedule. Not sure people can understand unless they are in the situation I guess 06:14:17 Sorry about it being late, I have OCD with things like that .. there are still things that are bugging me but it's close enough I guess. Hope everyone will enjoy it Shane 11/30/2023 at 06:12:47 EST I do care, probably too much. I have to learn to care less to be honest, it affects my health and mentality a lot. But I do care, as I said, probably too much. I had to work those updates into my already crazy schedule meaning I slept 10 hours in the past almost 5 days now. Probably not the best time for me to be chatting in here due to current level of stress / tiredness but just wanted to say I do care. Shane 11/29/2023 at 07:38:09 EST CM will deal with it 07:38:06 too busy, sorry guys 07:38:02 I am not going to get involved Shane 11/26/2023 at 13:01:25 EST hi there - sorry I am off guys. 4am and I need to wake up fairly early. I am sure the CM will post the announcement on other socials when they are free, I just posted on Discord + my twitter.

- sorry I am off guys. 4am and I need to wake up fairly early. I am sure the CM will post the announcement on other socials when they are free, I just posted on Discord + my twitter. Bye all Shane 11/26/2023 at 13:00:34 EST that is a separate article, also very complex Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:59:55 EST nono lunch break 1st year uni Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:59:12 EST 1 - I think I have answered this in the past, both are complicated and require a lot of thought before we approach it. It's come up numerous times but we have higher priorities unless we want to delay something else. 2 - No, I think all are active now linking perfectly together. Two places for E-ther and four for Essence Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:57:20 EST sleep! Sorry, I am really tired guys .. my weekend has been non-stop work, I really need some sleep Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:56:30 EST not sure what you mean there Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:56:01 EST if by hitting the gym you mean sitting in my chair giving my back so much of a work out I can feel it, then yes, have been hitting it hard daily Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:54:13 EST the first video we're going to drop will give some indication on the progress we've made on #E2V1. The second video is yet undecided what we are going to show, but it may include some game play which would be cool. The second video we show also depends a little on whether something else happens in time or not, so I'll just leave it at that Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:51:03 EST I am not committing to any dates sorry, even broad ones like that, but I think you know what I want to do. We're pushing it, high priority. Compared to other studios we only have a very, very small team working on this and while we're making more hires, it's a lot of work for a small team. We're pushing hard, I and the team want to get the pre alpha out too Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:48:47 EST for the token, yes Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:47:45 EST yeah I love that footage, watched it so many times and found it enjoyable so I thought others might too Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:46:55 EST I have answered that a few times elsewhere I believe Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:46:05 EST there is a lot of information in the article, it explains a lot in more detail. You can probably see why I said I couldn't just summarise everything into one comment on discord Shane 11/26/2023 at 12:45:08 EST I can't say when exactly, it's in the pipeline but we're working on quite a number of things. 12:44:26 almost 4am and has been a very full on weekend .. I am also off to bed now.

you log in to Earth 2 page all detected E-ther from the past 48 hours will be offered for you to claim: The E-ther Icon in the top bar is highlighted. By clicking on it, a popup appears and informs you about the amount of claimable Essence. By clicking Claim, the Essence is now claimed. Each tile has a daily chance of evaporating 1 E-ther. Mentars on larger properties usually have lower efficiency in detecting the evaporating E-ther, but their effectiveness can be boosted by filling the Mentars' open Jewel slots. Detected E-ther will vanish 48 hours after evaporating on your property, so it is important to visit Earth 2 to claim your E-ther regularly. Once you claim your detected E-ther, you will be asked to transform it into Essence. When you click the Transform button, your E-ther will be turned into Essence. Not all E-ther is the same, so the same amount of E-ther can yield a rather wide range of Essence. The Ether to Essence conversion rates for Tier 1 and Tier 2 also affect Essence generation. What is a Blueprint? A Blueprint is a design or technical drawing created by a player that has been saved and includes one or more virtual HoloBuildings. By owning a specific blueprint, you can create, edit, position, and place it on your property. If you are the creator or if you own the full rights to a created blueprint, you will be able to sell your blueprint to other players who will in turn have the right to place that blueprint design on their properties or use it inside Earth 2. What is a HoloBuilding? A HoloBuilding is the resulting product of a Blueprint that has been activated, constructed then placed on a Property. Amongst other things, HoloBuildings serve aesthetical and practical purposes inside Earth 2 What is a Property? A Property is a parcel of land owned by a player on Earth 2. The Editor allows you to search for Properties you own when placing or building a new Blueprint. What is Space? Space is the volume of a HoloBuilding which is stored inside the Editor. When placing new HoloBuildings on your Tiles, Space is generated and becomes part of every HoloBuilding. It can be utilized for various purposes such as storing resources, additional Essence, convertible Space volume toward Phase 3 structures, and more. If a player retrospectively decides to remove or reduce the volume of a HoloBuilding after it is placed on a property, part of the volumetric will be credited to their Space virtual wallet and will become available for subsequent HoloBuildings or other purposes yet to be disclosed. Boosted E-ther is first and foremost a massive bonus for all T1 and T2 lan that is visible day-to-day and has the potential to accrue substantially in the size of available E-ther weeks, months, and possibly years. The boost mechanics are applied to all T1 and T2 tiles and these mechanics have been designed in such a way that places full control of the potential benefits into the hands of any Players that own T1 or T2 land. The Earth2 Property Locator (EPL) (format of e2.me/nd) is a unique global identifier Players can upgrade on their property. It provides a similar function as a URL to a website yet for now, in holders' initial release, it is universal and more simplified. The EPL allows users to overwrite the standard cryptic identifier with a more EPLitsu and discoverable word or phrase. These words or phrases are unique and therefore limited and being universal will have limited availability. EPLs will be an integral part of the Earth 2 platform, be key in connectivity, and even have their own dedicated premium Earth 1 portal.

1 vs. Tier 2 Tiles: 1. Buying Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 Tiles: As of now, all player-owned properties will be classified by Earth 2 as Tier 1, and all unclaimed land on Earth 2 will be classified as Tier 2. With this change, only Tier 2 tiles will be available for purchase from Earth 2 and their prices will restart at E$0.10, increasing in value as more tiles are bought. Tier 2 tiles can also be traded in the Marketplace while Tier 1 tiles are acquired either by purchasing from a Tier 1 property owner or upgrading from Tier 2 tiles. However, original Tier 1 tiles assigned by Earth 2 are only obtainable through player-to-player trading with an original Tier 1 Property Owner. Only these original Tier 1 properties will have the promise of Essence from Earth 2. A player may upgrade their Tier 2 property to a Tier 1 property at any time. However, the cost of upgrading will vary as the Price-Per-Tile value of Tier 1 land tiles is dynamic and will continue to increase. To protect all original Tier 1 Property Owners who currently have listings on the Marketplace, a freeze on the Earth 2 Marketplace until Dec 14 inclusive will be implemented. With the Essence promised to all original Tier 1 properties, as well as the additional bonuses tied to those properties, the current Marketplace prices are no longer accurate reflections of the value of these properties. The freeze will give new Tier 1 Property Owners ample opportunity to withdraw their properties from sale. This is highly recommended by Earth 2. 2. Functions of Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 Tiles: Tier 1 and Tier 2 tiles are further differentiated by their functions. Most significantly, Tier 1 tiles have guaranteed Ether to Essence conversion and Essence generation while for Tier 2, the conversion and generation are unpredictable. In addition to guaranteed Essence generation, Tier 1 tiles have other generative abilities that Tier 2 tiles do not. In the future, Tier 1 Property Owners will have full access to discoverable resources while for Tier 2 tiles, access will be restricted. Resource saturation for Tier 1 is also boosted compared to the standard saturation for Tier 2. Tier 1 tiles will also continue to generate LIT (Land Income Tax / Period Bonus) and have the ability to assign EPLs while Tier 2 tiles will not. Tier 1 tiles will retain their land classes under Tier 1, while Tier 2 tiles will be labeled generally and no longer be distinguished by classes. 3. Additional Benefits of Owning Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 Tiles: Along with the functional superiority of Tier 1 tiles, Tier 1 Property Owners will enjoy a 7.5% referral code bonus with their unique and customizable referral codes. Tier 2 Property Owners will continue to receive 5% from their randomized referral codes. Finally, both Tier 1 and Tier 2 tiles will grant players access to the Earth 2 EcoSim, though there will be a building cap for Tier 2 tiles. Tier 1 Property Owners will be able to enjoy further benefits in-game and in the metaverse as Earth 2 plans to progressively release more bonuses in the future. Welcome to Earth 2, our world’s Geolocational Metaverse, meaning that the location you’re standing right now in the real world will also be digitally represented inside of Earth 2.

Are Territories? Territories are predetermined areas of land where borders have already been set in Earth 1, such as States, Provinces, or Counties. They are, for the most part, dependent on or form part of a Country. The introduction of Territories is unlike anything seen in Earth 2 to date in that each Territory release is exclusively determined by the votes submitted by active Earth 2 Players. When a Territory is voted to be released by the Players, it eventually gets locked into a release queue of Territories (see Territories Release section of the article). Only after this process, once a queued Territory is released, does the option for purchasing T3 land appear within that specific Territory. Tier 3 Land is the final Tier of land, there will not be a Tier 4. It is the base builder Tier land and although limited in some respects is also quite a speculator given its unique ability to lure neglected E-ther from the Boosted E-ther Pools, effectively allowing

4.docx","chunkIndex":0,"content":"Essence Whitepaper Delay, Messages for Holobuilders, the DRONE community & More Shane Isaac: “Hey Earth 2, I hope you're all doing well and keeping safe. My first topic for today is an important one, and I would like to personally deliver this message rather than releasing it in written format. The release of the Earth 2 white paper will be delayed. This decision was not made lightly, but after receiving ongoing extensive advice from internal and external Earth 2 stakeholders and advisors, it was deemed the most logical decision for the best interest of the Earth 2 community and the launch of the Essence token. I understand that many in the Earth 2 community have been looking forward to the official white paper release. While this may be disappointing news for many, I want to provide reasoning as to why this decision had to be made. The present uncertainty in the web 3 crypto and blockchain industry, with fluctuations in Ethereum and Bitcoin, has led to caution. The recent issues with various projects and exchanges have raised concerns, and delaying the launch of Essence is seen as a proactive step to ensure its success. Launching Essence during a bear market could pose challenges, and the timing is crucial. Releasing the white paper in close proximity to the Essence token launch ensures that interested individuals have a more immediate course of action. This approach aims to avoid frustrating those who would like to buy the token but could not if there's a significant gap between the white paper release and the token launch. While the white paper is delayed, the Earth 2 team is not sitting idle. The delay provides an opportunity to build more features, including upgrading from tier 1 to tier 2 land, using Essence to replicate resources in the ecosim, powering buildings, vehicles, and units, and more. The goal is to enhance the utility of Essence at the point of launch. A few details are shared regarding the Earth 2 team allocation of Essence. The 36-month vesting period has not started yet and will commence when the token launches. Players will be able to create a wallet from within their Earth 2 account to transact Essence, with Earth 2 not holding any keys for these wallets. Security measures, including 2FA activation and potential account validation, will be implemented to mitigate the risk of hacking. Essence token allocation percentages will be adjusted in the official release, with a reduced team allocation and additional allocations for centralized exchange listings. The Essence token launch will be accompanied by a white paper, a video of E2 V1 footage, and closer proximity to more features utilizing Essence inside Earth 2. The video also covers updates on Earth 2's development, including the progress of hollow buildings, a marketplace for hollow buildings, and the long-term plans for these player-created structures. The Earth 2 team is committed to the development of Drone the Game, assuring the community that efforts will continue to complete the remaining promises made by the FSI team. The message concludes with the announcement of the speaker's temporary absence for a few weeks due to various meetings and talent acquisition efforts. During this time, community managers and the team in Australia will arrange country release countdowns and mentor gifting promotions.

for Video: Deep Dive on Raiding & Droid Game Mechanics for the Earth 2 Community Hi there, my name is Shane Isaac, and I am the CEO and founder of Earth 2. So, I'm here today to talk about one of the new game accounting systems we are building for the Earth through Community the very first iteration of what we refer to as rating this talk will also include details about droids as droids and raiding are inherently linked to one another if you're new to Earth 2 or you've only heard information from unofficial sources and fine Earth to intriguing I highly suggest spending a few minutes of your valuable time to watch this video additionally if game design interests you then feel free to provide your own thoughts or feedback below as there are often different perspectives and approaches to solving the same problem and we'd love to hear any constructive ideas or suggestions you might have in follow-up videos I will also touch base on two of our other work in progress game mechanics systems which are civilians and play-to-player contracts hopefully this will allow anyone interested to understand these four initial game mechanics which is raiding droids civilians and player-to-player contracts and how they fit together to provide an interesting and engaging experience on our website as we slowly build toward the release of our one-to-one scale digital 3D World we often to refer to as e2v1 as many of you know we are building a massive open world metaverse platform and to me personally when I think metaverse I also think of gamified experiences amongst many other things so the initial for game mechanics I have referenced serve as an initial light introduction that will represent probably a fraction of the future game mechanics we have planned for Earth too so by no means should these game mechanics be interpreted as this is all the Earth 2 metaverse is going to be or this defines the Earth to metaverse indefinitely what I am going to talk about today is just the next step on our journey to building this geolocational metaverse focusing more on some of the gamification elements and not things like the economic simulator building creating experiences internal environments customization delivering 3D commercial and Retail Solutions trading systems and other things like that so these are many of the other long-term goals we have for Earth 2 but they won't be included in this specific talk so now that's clear let's jump in the game Mechanics for my rating concept solve six short-term problems for us and for Earth two number one rating provides active Earth 2 players with something more Hands-On to do during the waiting period as we lead into the next phase features of the ecosim such as resource generation trading and building and the future release of our 3D World e2v1 so basically it gives players something to do in the interim number two rating also brings the opportunity for potential reward to those players who are active on our platform something I am very much proactive about and I believe strongly in the rewarding of players who support and believe in the long-term goal of Earth 2. we've seen this time and time again with recent feature releases and that will continue in the in the near future the third benefit of raiding is that it allows us to design and Implement key game mechanics via our current web page interface but these are mechanics that also are relevant for e2v1 in the future so we're building systems and game mechanics now that will have long-term relevance to our platform for number four raiding also provides us with an opportunity to build and test our new back-end game engine I'm not talking about the visual game engine I'm talking about the mechanics the Crux the calculations that are happening in the background this engine will inevitably also be used inside of e2v1 for a multitude of reasons such as pinpoint tracking of moving Vehicles inside our massive world power storage and drain calculating roaming ranges and much more that will become evident throughout this video and upcoming videos so for example whether we had a Droid traveling from West End into Hyde Park or traveling from London to Paris this back-end system that we're building will be able to tell us real time where that Droid is and not only where that Droid is but millions of other droids at the same time all in real time the fifth benefit of raiding is that it provides a light introduction to behaviors processes flows and core mechanics and ideologies we will see long term inside of Earth too and particularly the ecosim and finally number six and quite possibly most importantly rating adds more core utility to the existing digital items you can earn today by owning land inside of Earth too such as direct utility for ether new utility for Essence and joules and the introduction of new digital items with new utilities such as droids in this particular video I'll cover the details about rating and droids as I know many in our community are curious about how this will work and wanted to understand details about these mechanics in advance so before we release it so today I'm not only going to talk about that but will also walk you guys through some of the actual UI designs as pictures can often and paint a thousand words and I believe those designs also provide a little insight into some of the problems we had to solve and how we approach solving those problems before I jump into that I'll quickly cover a little background on Virtual land inside of Earth 2. so from day one my core short and long-term goals have always been to add purpose and utility to land inside of Earth 2 over time rewarding and providing opportunities to those who own land so that almost anything that happens inside of Earth 2 is linked back to land somehow I wanted to create this virtual world in which almost everything built somehow comes from utilizing or toiling player on land in one way shape or form so much like the real world inside of Earth 2 almost everything stems from player-owned Land This approach has already been demonstrated on Earth too as we've seen it gradually come into play during our platforms brief to your history for a new player buying new land today they can purchase the land then build a free Mentor which is then able to detect ether evaporation which generally happens over 48-hour Cycles after detected this ether can then be collected by the player via the mentor and is either stored as ether or optionally transformed from ether into essence being the core long-term digital commodity that will have extensive utility inside of the earth through platform different types of land can also spawn Jewels which are collectible by the players and tradable on one of our internal player to player Marketplace is named the bazaar just to make it clear players don't buy the jewels from Earth too they collect them there's been over two million US dollars’ worth of trade between players already today just with jewels alone which we consider as a as one of our minor digital Commodities today Essence also has some limited utility being used in the process of crafting special types of jewels and more recently for staking during the resource validation opportunity Jules also have some current utility as well to increase ether detection on player owned land and in the near future significant utility for resource production inside of the ecosim that is in addition to the rating concept which will also inevitably add more utility to Ether Essence and joules and all the above we are definitely committed to a long-term goal to adding an increasing amount of utility to Essence and all other types of digital Commodities inside of Earth 2. I won't jump down the rabbit hole of Earth 2's ideologies such as putting more focus and benefit onto the player with giving them control of selling or trading digital items they own on the Earthly

inevitably add more utility to Ether Essence and joules and all the above we are definitely committed to a long-term goal to adding an increasing amount of utility to Essence and all other types of digital Commodities inside of Earth 2. I won't jump down the rabbit hole of Earth 2's ideologies such as putting more focus and benefit onto the player with giving them control of selling or trading digital items they own on the Earthly platform it's clear we want to share in the success with our players on the Earth 2 platform while also providing them an experience unlike other platforms which sell digital items or digital Goods to their player base without that support or ability to trade for real money between the players so I'm saying if you buy a skin on another game you own that skin you can use that skin but you can't sell it to another player Earth 2's ideology is very much against that we want players to be able to trade it between other players indefinitely so now let's take a closer look at what raiding Androids are and then we will walk through some of the planned UI ux you will see go live on the website hopefully in the next few weeks this is very much still a work in progress as much like anything inside of Earth 2. we're constantly reviewing balancing and altering things where necessary so what you will see today will be a very close representation of what goes live on our website but there may be small changes especially to any figures you see of how much something might cost or how much energy it might use and so forth so please be careful to bear this in mind when you watch this video so let's look at what droids are and let's look at a little bit of the background mixed with the law source speak as new and popular cultures beliefs and factions emerge within the metaverse concentrated mental energies generated from these groups fused together to form what we call metasprites are the incorporeal states of the droids loyal to their origin factions culture and Rome Free through the Earth through metaverse as ethereal beings a mixture of civilizations living within a close proximity May inadvertently Place intense pressure on a matter Sprite once it forms so that once it begins to take shape as a Droid it defects and has no connection or allegiance to any faction whatsoever preferring to spend its time as a solo neutral Droid ethereal droids inexplicably have a deep and Powerful connection with mentors they also speak to each other in some otherworldly way and roam around the meta seeking new mentors to explore despite its desire to roam it is not unusual for a meta Sprite to be captured quite close to where it was formed though many are still able to Traverse within the metaverse in many different ways it has discovered that with the use of essence these ethereal Droid forms can be hacked and captured to reveal their binary composition data with this vital data available the energized Essence and Mentor learns how to work together to fuse and amalgamate the essence into an actual physical Droid as soon as the Droid is created it is automatically Tethered to the mentor with which it shares a special kind of bond however unaccustomed to the new body droids need to be powered using powered cells in order to utilize their physical form when being relocated or sent out on what we will learn about raids power cells are created using Essence and they can only be charged while the Droid is Tethered to a mentor when first created most droids will only be able to hold a certain amount of ether travel at a certain set speed relocate a certain distance and consume their power cell energy at a certain rate however the powerful spiritual presence of jewels can hack into the meta code of the Droid and recode certain Droid functions and abilities such as speed storage and so forth a Droid can only be relocated among the same network of mentors as these mentors create a special connection between them to boost the travel capabilities so that the Droid can travel very far distances over neighboring lands when droids are sold which is something that will come at a later stage a very special temporary connection between the two mentors will appear allowing the Droid to be transferred once the Droid arrives at the new Mentor they will have to go through a tethering process where they are recoded to assimilate into the new environment and form a new relationship with that new mentor droids are very useful to their owners and can be sent to raid neighboring properties of any uncollected ether built from a fusion of metasprite essence and Mentor energy only droids have the power to hack into unsecured mentors and deliver the uncollected leftover ether back to the owner since a Droid is distance from its own Mentor when raiding it will use significant energy to venture onto enemy land in order to capture that precious ether for its owner however droids are very loyal to their mentors and when sent on raids they will wait up to hours despite the power drain meticulously scanning the entire property for a chance to discover and retrieve some of that ether evaporates from tiles of player-owned land all over the Earth and can be detected by mentors detected ether will vanish after about 48 hours but due to the slightly unstable nature of ether the mentor cannot secure The Ether for the last 24 hours whilst The Ether is unsecured surrounding properties can send droids to raid ether from that Mentor which can detect the unsecured ether on that actual Mentor droids will follow the direct orders of their owners and are completely dependent on their owners strategies to help them maximize their opportunities at raiding ether there can be multiple droids at a mentor at any given time and each of those Droids on the raid will have an equal chance of obtaining ether at the time it's unsecured however some droids may miss out if the competition is too high especially for Droids raiding from large properties where a large quantity of ether is released that would attract more participants trying to raid the property so as a quick summary droids and raiding are all built around player-owned land ether is available for any player to collect on their property for generally a 48-hour period a player's Mentor will keep that ether stable for around about 24 hours after that 24 hour period it becomes unstable and other players are able to send their droids to raid that property during that period of time this gives every player a 24-hour period to claim their ether if they don't it becomes open market this will become more difficult over time but in the beginning it will be quite simple every player will be able to defend against this by claiming their ether within the first 24-hour period from internal statistics we understand that there is going to be a lot of different ether available at different times and there will be a lot of different strategies that players explore to find where that available ether is if they find a nice inactive property do they share that with others or do they keep it to themselves so that's a brief introduction to raiding and droids now there are a lot of different strategies that will come out of this to understand how detailed this game mechanics actually is let's look at some of the UI and walk through it I'll try and give some notes and comments as we progress everything together opens up an interesting amount of strategies that players will probably learn a little bit now about as we go through the UI but definitely when they get their hands on the actual game mechanics on the website you'll start to understand that there are a lot of different strategies and things to consider in order to be able to gain ether

little bit now about as we go through the UI but definitely when they get their hands on the actual game mechanics on the website you'll start to understand that there are a lot of different strategies and things to consider in order to be able to gain ether and transform it into Essence by using droids and raiding the entire game mechanics system for raiding Androids will migrate into e2v1 so much so that the Droids that you build now already function and work inside of e2v1 so if you build a Droid now you will see the actual 3D model that will be flyable and representable inside of the 3D e2v1 World So This truly is a stepping stone between website gameplay and e2v1 gameplay now for those of you who are interested I'll walk through some of the UI and I'll provide some feedback and thoughts on different things as we progress so what we're just about to jump in and have a look at in the UI will let you understand how much work and effort has gone into just delivering this this initial rating Android game mechanic a lot of it is focused on functionality so a lot of what you're going to see will migrate into e2v1 in the future from a functionality perspective but what this web version doesn't include is like things like the bells and whistles so if you build a Droid we're not going to have animated kind of scenes and if you send your Droid on a raid we're not going to have all of that animated yet or in 3D we'll be focusing on delivering that type of experience inside of e2v1 so instead of us wasting time implementing that system in the web browser I'd prefer our team to focus on delivering that inside of E2 V1 and you know maybe the video you guys see later this month will give you a bit of an indication of how it might look and feel inside etv1 so what we're looking at right now is a mock-up our front-end team have been focused on implementing these designs and these designs are slowly getting synced with a lot of the back end development so I'm going to be using this mock-up as a guideline to give you guys an insight into what you will expect when the when the rating and Droid game mechanic systems come online so the First new thing that you'll notice is this raid book players will be able to press on this read button to open up a list of the of their properties so obviously you'll need to own a property with a mentor owner and have Droids built or Tethered to that property in order to initiate array you'll notice a button here called the Droid management button we'll talk about that a little bit later that's an entire different section in itself dispense all will show you how many of your droids are sitting on your property with ether in their storage compartments ready to dispense The Ether back into your mentors and then back into your balance you might notice that some of these borders have different colors now this color scheme is related to the upcoming played to play a contract system so I won't talk about that now I'm just mentioning for those of you who might be curious as to why it's there that's its purpose it's to differentiate which properties are under your control as the owner which properties are under the control of another player even though you own that property and it helps you differentiate between the group and you might also see properties here that you're in control which belong to other players so I won't go into the detail now because that's all related to the player to player contract system and let's push for it when you click on a property you'll be able to see some of the property stats here things like how many droids you have dispensing ether at that at that time how many droids are full so how many droids are full of Ethan waiting to be dispensed how many droids you're building on your property at that time how many droids you have Tethered to your property because remember your mentors set up a network around the world and depending how far away the closest Mentor is you can relocate your droids to another property there are restrictions on this and we'll talk about those a little bit later you'll be able to see how many of your droids are out raiding at any given time you'll be able to see how many droids are idle so doing nothing they're just sitting there not being used and you'll be able to see how many droids are de-powered now Droids that have been de-powered just means they don't have any power in them to function at that time so each of these have their own internal drop down lists here you can see details about the Droids that are dispensing so you can see the Droid name you can see how much ether it's dispensing and you can see how long that's going to take when droids dispense ether and this is ether that you've successfully rated and collected from other properties it takes it takes some period of time you can also see how many droids are full so you can see the Droid name and how many are actually full in this case we're just showing two droids that are not yet full you can also see the droids being built including the time that Droid will have finished building you can see the droids tethering to your property so again the tethering process is allowing the Droid to learn the lay of the land and make sure that it has the right calculations to be able to find the ethernet any adjoining Properties or within a certain vicinity you can also see Droids that are raiding so in this case we have three droids out raiding you've got the Droid name you can see what it's doing it's waiting for ether detection you can see the property details of the property that that Droid is rating in the next droid down here you can see that this Droid is traveling to the raid location in the third example here you can see that it's returning to your base we covered idle droids earlier and the d-powered droids have also been explained in order for Droids to function they need charge so assuming that you've built a Droid and you've given it a power cell you'll need to charge that Droid and you'll need to recharge it for different rates so in this example here you can see that there's a there's a notification showing that three of your droids require charge you can hit that button to charge all three of those droids at the same time you also have this other option to individually dispense all the ether for a particular property so in this case we can see this property has droids sitting on it with a collective amount of 10 ether you can tap that to dispense to dispense or now in order for you to start your reading Journey you need to have joints we have a build option here for you to start building Droids on your property as explained earlier droids before they enter the physical state inside of Earth 2 they are meta Sprites that are flying around in a spirit ethereal State your Mentor has the ability to detect and capture that as long as you have the essence to be able to build it so you use Essence to be able to capture that Droid bring it into your Mentor or the Meta Sprite or a Droid bring it into your mentor and then start the building process now once you press build you'll be able to select how many droids you want to build you'll be able to see the cost of build so you'll how much Essence that's going to cost per Droid and we've got five lessons here but we're still balancing this it's probably going to be around about two and a half Essence I'll get to it a little bit later but certain property sizes will be able to host a certain number of droids so the biggest property for size 750 tiles will be able to host 10 Droids that will be the maximum there's a staggering increase between a few tiles up until 750 tiles that allows you to have a different number of Droids on

number of droids so the biggest property for size 750 tiles will be able to host 10 Droids that will be the maximum there's a staggering increase between a few tiles up until 750 tiles that allows you to have a different number of Droids on your property at the moment we're saying the build time for each Droid is one day so we're building three droids each of them are going to cost x amount of essence each and the build time is going to be three days you also have this option to pre-power your Droid so you can build Droids that are not powered so you can just build the physical joints themselves but before you do anything with the Droid it needs to be powered so we've just given you this option to pre-power your droids at the same time you build your Droid one of the reasons that we've implemented the system in this way is because player to player contracts in its first iteration will have limited capability for the contracted player to be able to spend the other players Essence so to be able to spend the essence of the owner that will be included in later versions therefore owners are going to have to take the plunge to at least build all the Droids on their properties before another player can take over a contract to start operating the property you can understand why we've done this for now because obviously there is some value in essence and we don't want to kick off the player to play a contract with the ability for the Contracting pled to just go crazy with the essence balance of the owner the owner is going to have to take the plunge and spend the time to build these Droids on each of their properties once you've made your selections here you can start the build if you've selected the pre-power droids option it will show you how much Essence that is required I had to power those drugs I've alluded to the fact on a number of occasions that power things inside of Earth to you need essence is power in this instance you need to load Essence into your droids in order to power them in for them to be recharged initially and we're not sure if we're going to change this it could stay this way but initially whatever essence you put into your Droid to give it this charge you can later take out the exact same amount so if you for example need five Essence to power your Droid you can put that Essence into your Droid you can use your Droid you can fly it around you can get it to do things you can recharge it continuously through your mental to reuse it and reuse it when you de-pal your Droid your Droid just has to be at its full charge before it's de-powered and then you can take your five Essence back out so it's just adding utility it's kind of like staking your essence into the Earth 2 metaverse in order for it to do things and potentially give you some kind of reward so it's a massive utility for Essence now that's just a very high level of how the energy power cell system will work and it's probably just good to understand that from this point in time moving forward once you decide to build the droids you'll get another notification pop up just confirming all of the details how many droids you're building in what location what the cost is of those droids to be built how much Essence you're using to pre-power those droids if you decided to pre-power and just a another little disclaimer there as with many things inside of Earth 2 I like to reward early players proactive players people who are using the platform and trying out features in their early stages this process of building droids here is going to be the easy process later after we launched the ecosim they're going to be different steps that players are going to have to take to be able to build droids so this is a unique opportunity for these early players to really have this ability to build up some Droid armies so to speak we still have the narrative there and there still may be certain types of Droids that you can you can capture and bring to your mentor to be constructed but in the future you can imagine especially inside e2v1 you can imagine your ranges or your avatar running out running around inside the world and being able to capture these metasprite Droids uh keep them with you and then take them to a specific building to be able to construct so this as with many things inside of Earth 2 is going to start out easy and become more and more difficult over time something else I'd like to just talk about quickly is the transition or the migration of this game mechanics from the website into e2v1 and I talk about this a lot however I think it's quite cool and quite interesting how we've approached this in the building of droids so every single type of droid that you can build in the system at the moment as I've mentioned earlier will be usable inside of e2v1 so in this build process you won't find out what type of droid you have until the end of the process so once the Droid is built you'll be able to see which meta Sprite your Mentor managed to capture and build different types of droids have different types of Rarities so there's different types of chances to build different types of droids from it as you can see on your screen here are a few examples our team have already designed over 30 of these some of the droids you can see might suit different purposes for now all the droids will have the same type of functionality but in the future you might find out that your Droid can do something different but just to be clear every Droid right now serves the same functionality as far as the rating is concerned each and every one of these Droids have been designed by our team internally we're not going to show you all of the different types of droids designed so far because we'd like people to find out and discover some of those given the different Rarities that are out there so when you start to build droids you might discover one that nobody's found before and you'll be able to share that and review and as I mentioned earlier each and every Droid is fully compatible inside e2v1 now back to the current UI design another feature implementation without it is the relocate option I talked about that a little bit earlier it allows players to relocate their droids between their own mental properties based on a number of different restrictions when you press on the relocate button you'll be able to select the number of Droids that you want to relocate if you're on a specific property you'll be able to see all the Droids on that property what they're doing and be able to relocate them a Droid must be idle for it to be relocated so it's going to give you a list of preference with Droids that are idle at the top of that list here we start to see some of the statistics for each and every draw you'll be able to see how fast the Droid can move you'll be able to see how much ether that droid's carrying you'll be able to see the charge of the Droid like how much power that Droid has internally you'll be able to see how far that Droid can potentially travel based on the power that it has and a number of other factors you'll be able to see how economical that Droid is so the economical sense of the Droid is influenced by how the jewels have been slotted onto the Droid and some other things so there are a number of different factors and pieces of data that determine how far a Droid can relocate to another property this also becomes important for the rating aspect but we'll get to that in a little bit after I've selected the Droid I'll be able to see which properties are available for relocation I can see here that I've got a property on Banana Island uh it shows me how many droids are on that property at the moment it shows me how many are

the Droid I'll be able to see which properties are available for relocation I can see here that I've got a property on Banana Island uh it shows me how many droids are on that property at the moment it shows me how many are incoming on that property and how that affects the total number of Droids that that property can have I have a really cool relocation dual setup on this Droid so I can move up to a thousand kilometers for this one then once I hit relocate the Droid is going to begin its Journey relocating from one property to another property and then tethering to that new Mentor before it can be used again to raid properties within that location next we move over to the power option so after you press on power you'll have two options you can look to power droids or deep power drones so obviously powering droids is going to provide you with a list of Droids on that property that are not powered so if you built the droids and for whatever reason you decided to not to power those droids or if you had a drought on a property and you de-powered it for whatever reasons your Droid is going to show up in this list and this gives you the ability to repower it again in order to power a Droid I select the number of Droids that I want to power I've got a list here again I've got all these idle droids you can see they have no power and no efficiency they can't do anything because they don't have any power cells inside them once I've selected the Droids that I want to power I will have a total provided to me down the bottom here that tells me how much Essence is going to be required to power those drawers the other option you have here is to depower your Droid so obviously this is going to provide you with a list of Droids on that property that are fully powered and give you the option to de-power them you're not going to be able to select Droids that are not 100 charged so droids need to have a full charge to be able to de-power the essence this syncs up with the whole ideology that you put a full Essence in and you get a full Essence out so you can't put Essence into a Droid use up the energy and then get that Essence out because it hasn't been fully recharged it doesn't cost Essence to recharge the droids that's just a process that at the moment happens through the mentor later in the ecosim we will probably have certain recharging buildings that allows you to do that final option we have here is obviously the most exciting or the most rewarding one and that is the raid button and I press on the raid button I'll be presented with an option to select which droids I want to send on array this will present me with a number of different details from each Droid on how far it can travel remember relocating and rating will have different ranges rating takes up more energy you'll see that you'll have a much shorter range to raid another property as compared to relocating between two of your properties and mentors range will be a lot shorter but it will still present you with all the details about the various Droids that are available for you to send on a raid so the first step you make here is to select which droids you want to raid with if you haven't rated any properties around the radius of this of your property yet you will have no history to select who to attack or who to who to try and rate in this case you need to go onto the map and select the property that you want to raise once you've raided a property you'll have the ability to keep that as a favorite list or as a recent list so you can re-rate it a lot easier in the future it will also show you the properties within range for the Droids that you've selected in this case you can see I'm sending one Droid to raid Mushroom Island in Canberra act Australia this auto rate option is something I'll talk about a little bit later now let's take a look at the new insight system that we've built for raiding and droids insights is a useful tool that presents the player with raid related statistics and trends that can prove vital when it comes to determining certain gameplay decisions and strategies in the future it is highly probable that insights will be a valuable reference for other future E2 gameplay features as well but for now the focus will solely be around raiding the insights interface will be accessible via the raid management section insights will be an unlockable feature at a later stage in another video I'll talk about how insights can be unlocked for players but for now let's just talk about what insights is and what it does so insights can be unlocked for both the property and its tethered droids upon selecting insights the player will initially be presented with a list of properties that have unlocked this insights functionality the player can also choose to view a list of the droids Tethered on these properties and wants a property or Droid is selected from the list their unique raid related insights will be made available to the player first let's take a look at a droid's insights a droid's insights will consist of five separate sections there are the droids power stats performance history success rate properties that have rated and a comparison against the player's highest performing droids the first section is a brief overview of the droids power stats this includes the Droid speed storage Energy Efficiency Max rate distance and Max relocation distance the potential of a droid's power stats relies heavily on the jewels slotted in them at this point in time the top of this section will also display a single line of the droid's most recent activity for convenience this may include its most recent raids relocations or upgrades the second section is the droids performance history that is a graphical display of the raids it has performed over time the player can see how much ether each of the droids raids resulted in if any if a player desires to only view a droid's successful raids over time for example rates that actually resulted in obtaining ether they may do so by selecting the successful raids button above the graph however this will not be the only information available in this section the player will also be able to view a droid's relocation and upgraded downgraded history over time this will be available as overlays throughout the graph depending on which buttons are selected or deselected for instance when relocation is selected the graph will display when and where a Droid has traveled when relocating between properties the trend line will also turn green for whenever the Droid was raiding for the property it is currently Tethered to when upgrades or downgrades is selected the graph will display when which and by how much a droid's power stats were affected each time its Jewels were re-slotted the third section will display a Droid success rate the success rate tells us how many of a droid's raids have successfully resulted in obtaining ether for example if a Droid has a success rate of 12.5 percent that means 12.5 percent of the droid's total raids have been successful and resulted in collecting ether the actual amount of successful and total raids a Droid has made will also be displayed Above This percentage below this we can see the number of unique properties the Droid has rated for instance this particular Droid has successfully rated 25 unique properties 75 times further down is the rated ether the Droid has obtained from their raids as well as this there will be two lines of data outlining the average ether obtained per raid and the average raids performed per day the fourth section will display properties the Droid has rated players can select whether they wish to view the properties they have rated the most or properties they

the average ether obtained per raid and the average raids performed per day the fourth section will display properties the Droid has rated players can select whether they wish to view the properties they have rated the most or properties they have gained the most ether from via the filter in the top left corner this information will be presented as a multi-layered interactable pie chart consisting of a central circle and two concentric rings the size and value of each segment in the inner concentric ring will indicate how many times a property has been rated in this case it appears that the Droid has rated join my mega City and please don't raid me the most out of all their rated properties however in order to make a proper assessment on whether this High rate frequency is actually worth the outcome the player can then reference the outer concentric ring and determine how much ether was actually obtained from these raids if we look at the example again although please don't raid me seems to be pulling its weight join my mega City despite having a significantly higher rate frequency has not obtained nearly as much ether as Diamond heads who in return has a notably lower rate frequency finally the Centric Circle will initially display the total ether rated by the Droid within the specific time frame however this value may change depending on what segment is selected for instance if a segment from the inner ring is selected the raid frequency of said property will be displayed as a percentage of the total rates committed if a segment from the outer ring is selected The Ether rated from the selected property will be displayed as a percentage of the total ether rated the player may also interact with the button bar above if they wish for the pie chart to display all the properties the Droid has rated across its entire lifetime or solely the property it has rated whilst Tethered to the current property the final section will include a column graph comparing the player's best performing droids with the Droid currently selected the player will be able to alternate between viewing a graphical display of the droids who have collected the most ether and the droids with the highest success rate there will be a Max sample of 20 droids presented in these graphs positioned in descending order based on the values of the allocated rectangular bars when ether is selected then each rectangular bar will consist of the total ether collected by each Droid similarly if the success rate is selected then each rectangular bar will depict the success rate of each Droid towards the end of each graph will be the current Droid the player is viewing the player will therefore be able to compare the performance of their droids based on its total rated ether and success rate finally let's take a look at what a property's individual insights would entail a property's insights will consist of five different sections the property insights overview a statistical comparison section A graphical display of rated properties a pie chart depicting The Ether contribution of its tethered droids and a graphical display of a property's rates a properties overview will display seven different types of information four of which will be displayed as a row of circular holders the first Holder will display the total ether a properties Droid has rated if we look at the interface we can see that this particular property has rated a total of 15 ether and its most recent successful rate resulted in three ether we can also see that this property has the seventh highest ether yield out of the players total properties the total number of droids Tethered to a property will also be displayed in the section if there are droids relocating to or from the property the number of droids relocating will be displayed as a bracketed number below a property success rate which as mentioned before tells us how many raids have been successful in obtaining ether it is apparent that 65 of the grades made by this property have been successful however the absence of a given rank indicates the success rate is not within the player's top 10 highest success rates this may suggest that although the property has rated a substantial amount of ether it was due to the quantity rather than the quality of the rates the final circular display will present the total raids and number of unique properties rated by the properties tethered droids below this row will be two lines of data the first line will depict the average ether obtained per raid and day the second line will display the average rate frequency rate per day similarly to that of the Droid section a line of data depicting the property's most recent raid related activity will also be displayed within the inside segment the second section of a property's insights is the statistical comparison this is mainly an interactable line graph that illustrates the properties daily obtained ether or success rate over time players May select a comparative Trend to display next to the ether or success rate trends in an attempt to identify a particular correlation between them the comparative Trends will consist of the total rates successful raids and actively rating droids per day depending on the variables values present in the graph the left and right axes will alter just remember that the right axes will always represent the data type of the comparative Trends while the left axes will represent The Ether or success rate over time depending on what is selected it is also important to note that ether can be represented as a cumulative trend this is a standalone Trend so that players will not be given the option to compare it with the previously mentioned comparative data sets until it has been reverted back into single stats form the third section includes a multi-biographical display of the properties rated by the droids Tethered to the player's property the main goal of this section is to allow the player to compare their rated properties against each other and determine how profitable each property is each property will consist of three groups of data these are the number of times a property has been rated the number of successful rates and the total ether obtained from said successful rates the player will also be able to choose which properties are presented in this graph for instance if they desire to display the properties they have rated the most or the properties they have gained the most ether from they may do so by selecting the drop down Above This section allows players to see just how useful a property's droids are by presenting how much ether obtained by each Droid actually contributed to the property's total rated ether the player will be able to select whether they wish to view this information as a pie chart or as a table if we select a pie chart we can see that each of its segments represents how much ether each Droid has collected while the central circle displays the total ether rated by all the properties droids please note that there will be a max amount of Droids that can be displayed in this pie chart so all the ether obtained by the droids with the lowest ether contribution will be combined as its own segment this same information can also be displayed as a table consisting of three columns the first being the droids the second The Ether contribution as a percentage and the third being the actual value of ether contributed if a player only wishes to view The Ether rated by the droids currently tethered they may do so by selecting the appropriate drop down the final section allows players to view all the raids they have from the selected property they may choose to either view a multi-bar column graph of the most

droids currently tethered they may do so by selecting the appropriate drop down the final section allows players to view all the raids they have from the selected property they may choose to either view a multi-bar column graph of the most recent reads made to a specific property or all the raids made on a specific date hence is unique in that it will hold two of these multi-bar column graphs simultaneously the first graph will automatically display all the raids of the most recent raid day the values on the horizontal axis will therefore hold all the locations rated on this date each location will consist of three groups of data The Ether obtained the number of droids sent and the number of competing droids encountered while rating that Target property it is highly likely that players will use this section with a specified date and or property in mind for instance let's say that we see a sudden drop-in rated ether via the statistical comparison graph the player can then identify and input the date with which this drop occurred into the graph and view which properties had been targeted the player May then discover a substantial amount of competing droids encountered while rating these properties it may then be wise to either Target other less popular surrounding Properties or relocate the property's droids to another location with potentially more ether yield now let's do a quick run through on how the Droid management section will function as the title suggests the Droid management section will help you to micromanage your entire Droid Fleet whether by accessing droids directly or filtering out particular Droids on certain properties to access this section players will first have to select the raid management button which will load a new page once in this page the player can then select the Droid management button in order to view and access all their droids they can alternate between viewing a list of their droids or a list of their properties which when selected will display the droids Tethered to those properties if we take a closer look we can see that each listed Droid will have four of its powered stats displayed these are the droids speed ether hold capacity Energy Efficiency and the number of joules that have been slotted into the Droid the date with which the Droid has been built will also be displayed in the top right corner of the Droid card and this may be important over time if the Droid has been newly built a new tag in place of the date will be displayed for a temporary period of time allowing you to easily identify new Droids that you've recently built upon selecting a Droid its general information will be displayed on the right hand side of the list the information presented in this section includes the droid's name its location its status the number of joules slotted on the Droid its Rarity level the storage Speed Energy Efficiency Max relocation and rate distances total raids the success rate total ether obtained and the total unique properties rated the player is also able to do two minor things in this section they can rename the Droid and power or depower their power cells using assets although this section displays a lot of useful information about individual droids the feature that will surely receive the most utilization is the Dual slotting feature which is accessible via selecting the Dual slotting option next to Droid info upon this selection the list of droids will be replaced with the player's dual inventory while the droid's info will simultaneously be replaced with the droid's slotting feature the quality quantity and combination of the Dual slotted into each Droid can significantly improve the overall effectiveness of the droid's abilities during raid missions these abilities are a Droid Speed Max ether hole capacity Max relocation and rating travel range distances and Energy Efficiency the player simply needs to drag and drop the drills from the inventory into each of the droid's Dual slots each time a jewel is slotted its effects on the droid's power stats will be displayed in the results section below once a player is satisfied with the results they can select the apply button to officially but not permanently confirm the slotting if the player is unsatisfied with their slotting changes they may alternatively select cancel which would subsequently undo all the unapplied sliding alterations they have made so there you have it you have a brief overview of how raiding Androids will be introduced into Earth 2 what it will look like some idea about the long-term plan and how it will initially function this clearly shows our willingness and attention to add utility to key platform Commodities such as ether Essence and jewels all of which come from owning and using virtual land inside of Earth 2 and all of which our proactive supportive players have been diligently Gathering and sometimes trading today one of our goals behind the rating concept was to provide gameplay mechanics not only for super proactive players but also for casual players who'd like an option to participate inside of Earth 2 while navigating their busy day-to-day lives in my opinion over time this will actually create an interesting overlap between the Hands-On immersive player inside e2v1 in the future and the Casual player using less real-time Reliant game mechanics such as trading in this regard we're gradually building toward the first pre-alpha E2 V1 access sometime in 2023 to initially focus on showing game mechanics such as raiding so game mechanics like rating would be viewable inside of E2 V1 in real time after we get that operational one of our follow-up goals will be to support player avatars running around inside of e2v1 while game mechanics such as raiding are concurrently playing out in real time creating I guess this kind of player-controlled and operated world that you not only View From a Distance but can jump into and interact up close and personal with so for example imagine droids being sent on a raid but then as an avatar you could grapple hook onto one of the droids or even try to bring one down that's just one example but think along the lines of things like that where casual players are uh influencing gameplay that Hands-On Avatar players can also interact with from there we then add some gameplay to explore loot PVE and things really start to get interesting it's already pretty addictive just running around and exploring e2v1 as it is so massive and expansive so I don't know I just think that things will really start to get quite interesting at that point and once we hit that Milestone now when we release rating on the website it will obviously be the first iteration a first iteration you can already see is very detailed and robust and easy to defend against but things will become harder and more riskier as players realize our long-term expansion plans for reading and droids inside of Earth 2. I'm referring to things like more direct P verse p with like intercepting other players droids distill ether the ability to defend against such attacks and other interesting additions that I'm not going to reveal just yet we will test the core based mechanics in this first iteration of raiding over the next few months why and while balancing we'll start to add some of these bells and whistles and some of these extra fun parts to make things a little bit more interesting and there are other changes coming too so Jewels are going to be harder to collect amongst many other things so enjoy the good times when they last for larger accounts which earn a lot of properties the first iteration of rating may prove too time consuming for you as one person two play across all of your properties will probably be quite difficult so I suggest you use this initial time as a learning curve on how the mechanics will work the release of civilians and then later player to player contracts both of

collect amongst many other things so enjoy the good times when they last for larger accounts which earn a lot of properties the first iteration of rating may prove too time consuming for you as one person two play across all of your properties will probably be quite difficult so I suggest you use this initial time as a learning curve on how the mechanics will work the release of civilians and then later player to player contracts both of these things being things that the team will focus on implementing once the first iteration of rating goes live we'll definitely make the players life easier especially those larger property owners and they'll introduce direct collaboration for mutually agreeable benefits between contracted players so just use the first iteration of rating to learn how it works and then some of the other things that we will be releasing subsequently will assist in those larger Property Owners being able to maintain all of their properties with help of other players with the help of other players so if you are a player who owns a lot of properties maybe just use this time before contracts are released to at least build Droids on all the properties you want to use for raiding so that they're ready to go for other players to control once the player-to-player contract system is released as you would have learned through this video there are many moving parts to the raiding and Droid mechanics and while this image does not cover all of those moving Parts the visualization of droid's basic stats paints a detailed picture on how they can be used so I thought it's worthwhile sharing this little image one of our concept artists put together we have base stats like the Droid weight 100 kilograms in this example many droids are actually a little less than the size of a small car you have the number of Power Cell sockets determining how many sockets the Droid has power cells for to be loaded you have the size of the power cell the Droid can take which also determines how much Essence is required to charge that power cell and ultimately determines how long that power cell can last you have the base relocation range the basic starting range for a Droid to relocate between networked mentors that is you have the range rate the basic starting range that a Droid can travel when launching into a raid and a little fun fact a one kilometer radius puts almost 9000 tiles in range so imagine how much this multiplies if you decide to strategize with the use of joules to expand that Droid raid radius a little food for thought there is also the storage Bay determining how much total ether that Droid can safely carry before needing to dispense so that's another strategy you might want to slot your jewels in a way that allows your Droid to carry more ether especially if you've found a very lucrative property to raid you've got the top speed of the Droid which will probably become important for a multitude of reasons over time and once again is affected by the jewels that are slotted you've got the number of jewels a Droid can have slotted at one time uh you've got the time that Droid takes to discharge ether sometimes you might want that to happen a little bit faster so there'll be various things you can do for that then there are performance stats based on the loaded Power Cell and other attributes which tells you how much charge you have how many minutes and how far a distance you have on your Droid you won't be able to send a Droid to Raider property if it does not have enough charge for the return trip so if your Droid cannot make the return trip you won't be able to send it to that property however if your Droid leaves on one of these valid round trips but waste too much time on the property scanning for example maybe that ether wasn't available at the time you expected and then it runs out of power or it may have even collected The Ether and be on the trip home and run out of power the only way that Droid can then return to the base is via the mentor which slowly pulls it back at a snail's pace and when I say A Snail's Pace I mean very slow putting it out of action for a considerable amount of time so this is another strategy if you get too many of those you'll have Droids out there not working coming back very slow and suddenly the strategy shifts to slotting jewels that might improve your speed and your efficiency there are also things like work statuses and recharge specs I mean even with all the details I have covered in this lengthy video today there are still elements and algorithms I've not even touched on systems that we're building in the back end to allow these front-end experiences to function I didn't even touch on like the drain model for example and many other similar systems which will have long-term relevance for future game mechanics and systems that we've designed for rating and for the ecosim for Logistics and transportation and trading but all of these will have to wait for another day just remember that there is a lot happening in the background to make all of this function in the front end for you guys and yes I mentioned earlier that I was going to share some stats on the initial indications about how many raid ready droids various property sizes will be able to support so that should be up on the screen now you'll note that initially the mentors on Tiny properties do not have the power to launch droids out to raid another property Well for now I hope this was informative enough for the Earth 2 Community who have been interested in how rating will work I thank you very much for your patience um it I think rating was obviously or is obviously a little bit more complicated than what many people thought and I hope all of this provides you guys with an idea about what my personal approach to game design looks like so this is my direct involvement with the game design for us too and how I see it fitting with the overall vision and what myself and my new game design team has been able to turn around in a really short couple of months we want to release Game mechanics that are directly related to the long-term goals of Earth 2 the platform specifically having direct and relevant use inside of our 3D planned Earth e2v1 droids and raiding is only part of what our new team has designed so far there is still so much that you guys will see over coming months and I'm not talking about civilians and player-to-player contracts alone but also robust structured direction for the ecosim and so much more and some hints of that will probably come out in the release of our new website I have an amazing team around me who make sense of my sometimes crazy ideas and Direction and they actually improve on them and they just get things done which is so refreshing they are all doing such an outstanding job plus we now have the different phase Dev design teams all working closer together than ever thanks again and I look forward to releasing details about civilians and player-to-player contracts soon and I'm especially looking forward to releasing footage of e2v1 showing some of the cool progress and how phase

2 EcoSim | Important Details | Article Breakdown Hi there, my name is Shane Isaac, and I am the CEO and founder of Earth 2. now today we have a relatively large announcement it's a large article around the next stages of the ecosim so if your interest in Earth 2 is to jump inside e2v1 run around kill things find things blow things up socialize all of that other stuff that will happen inside of e2v1 this may not be the article for you if you're an Eco Sim player who's interested in owning land Building infrastructure trading having unlimited power kind of working behind the scenes collaborating or not then this article is probably very important for you and you might want to tag along now there's a lot of detail in this article so what I'm going to do is read through it here in real time with you guys and probably just add some comments here and there about various aspects or various parts that we cover to give a little bit more clarity and a little bit of background on what we're thinking the ecosim inside of her through we're aiming for it to be quite realistic so we're aiming for players to really have to work hard in order to create um you know amazing massive cities or trading hubs or whatever they may wish to um wish to own and build inside of Earth too so it's going to have a realistic approach and what this does is gives real intrinsic extrinsic value like True Value to what has been produced and what exists inside of Earth too instead of saying hey there it is um I just put it there there's actual work behind it and I think long term people will be able to appreciate the approach that I've wanted to take to this and uh have a real functioning economy behind the long-term vision of Earth 2. so if you see these big cities inside of Earth too you know there's a lot of work that's gone into getting those together to getting them looking good to getting them vibrant lifelike and tradable um it's really quite exciting and this aspect of the game I mean all aspects excite me but the ecosm having loved kind of RTS games myself in the past and uh yeah this type of thing just it does excite me on a massive global scale real-time interaction between players it's pretty cool so there's different details that I'll cover through this article I'm not going to try and think of them all now and cover them all right now so I'll jump in I'll start reading the article and just make comments here and there I've also decided to do this because I know a lot of you guys don't like sitting there and reading through a lot of people have asked well you know is there a video about it is there information about it so although I'm really busy I thought I put my hand up and try and do this so you guys have something easier to digest or listen to um okay so the title of the article is the Weaver prospecting side droids and resources so as we continue to release different facets of the ecosim we find ourselves moving closer to a fully-fledged operational based version and that's like that's the base version of the ecosystem a lot of the things that we've released to date have been parts of the ecosim all kind of coming together so once we once we kind of close in on these next facets we're getting to like this base operational version where you can you can collect resource you can generate raw materials you can build building blocks you can start building infrastructure manufacturing and all these other types of things one other thing to Just note very quickly is this article is an informative article giving players a heads up of what's to come there is a lot of design work that has gone on behind the scenes for the content inside of this article so it's not something we're going to say okay this is going to be ready tomorrow this is something that is going to take quite some time to implement from a development perspective uh but what this is doing is giving players a really succinct heads up on what's coming what we're focusing on and how things will function so players can understand how things will work in the future we're going to try and stick to what we write in these articles as closely as possible if anything changes we'll let you guys know but what you see in this article is just part of what we've now designed so we're very comfortable with releasing this there's a lot more information to come but this article in itself contains details that will that the ecosim player can look at can interpret and say okay well okay this is how it's going to work now I know now I know the next part of the ecosystem and how the different pieces are fitting together so as part of the next steps today marks the beginning of a process which will see the unveiling of 20 additional resources all of which will be discoverable on player-owned properties so we have the base resources at the moment they're the resources that we've already been working with we've got wood water and sand there's going to be a follow-up article and announcement on how that's going to work pre-e2v1 so that's an article that's been ready for some time but we wanted to get this one out first and follow up with this subsequent article about water wood sand so you guys are going to find out how that's going to work pre-e2v1 um and then there's these additional 20 resources that we're working with as I said we're looking for a super realistic kind of ecosim here and there's going to be a lot of different resources uh that that will be discoverable to players and we'll all have its part in the ecosystem the base resources that we have so far you'll already you'll be able to do a lot with those as it stands you'll already be able to do a lot with those these additional resources help us Branch off into specific technology uh routes uh arms of the ecosm special things maybe some cosmetics and other things like that so these additional resources while many of them are very important the base resources they're the they're the real Crux which is what we've been working with today now what this also does these 20 additional resources it helps maybe new players come in as well and be able to locate these probably rarer resources and what that does long term as well is help players trade um you know trade these Resources by doing themselves which is what we want we want a thriving environment long term inside of Earth to for players to be generating resources raw materials building blocks and using them for themselves but also trading them on a global scale so that a logistics system that trades them and that uh that is something that we will always be looking to promote okay I've just got through the first paragraph here and I don't know how many minutes I've been talking so I'll just I'll just keep going and try to keep this as short as possible so periodically one or more new resources will be unveiled at a time and the E2 prv system will open at the same time to accept claims for these resources on player-owned land so what that means is every week or two we will be releasing or revealing what one of these new resources is and that will give the opportunity to players to set up it'll open up the e2prv the player resource validation system to claim that resource if you feel you have that resource on any of your properties in this announcement we will reveal the prime Jewels for each resource so we're going to show the prime Jewels the jewels that are going to be important for these specific resources but we're not going to show what all the resources are yet they're going to be a bit of a surprise as we announce each one obviously some of the images uh you know in there you could of the resources you could probably tell what they are but

show what all the resources are yet they're going to be a bit of a surprise as we announce each one obviously some of the images uh you know in there you could of the resources you could probably tell what they are but uh we're still going to do it that way so you'll learn which Jewels are going to be important to Prime um in in order to get that resource but uh We're Not Gonna We're not gonna end yeah we're not gonna reveal all of the resources right now and the details on new prospecting side droids so prospecting cider is something we're going to cover the Weaver and their roles in the resource system inside of Earth too as with most features on Earth too resources have their own intricate design and more detailed information about this system is revealed below so ecosim Beginnings as Earth 2 is progressing closer and closer towards the alpha release of e2v1 many obviously are wondering how will the next part of the ecosim start so beginning today the ecosim is a topic we will be addressing in a dedicated series of upcoming articles scheduled for release throughout the year these articles will each detail the assets and processes that will be involved in the next stages of the ecosim so this is the first of a few articles that we'll release this year they're very highly detailed I don't quote me but I think the next one will be talking a bit about building blocks Logistics um a little bit about how that will work what you can what you can build with various building blocks raw materials and what have you now this series of announcements is designed to progressively educate the Earth through Community specifically those who are interested in the ecosim aspect of Earth 2. of the many features and mechanisms of the ecosim and prepare players for the final ecosim Chronicles announcement preceding the launch of version one of the ecosim or the base version that I referred to a bit earlier resources and Prime Jewels which are covered more deeply in this article are two of the cornerstones of the early ecosim and gameplay although we will not dive deeper into all the practicalities of the ecosystem this article rest assured buildings Logistics production transport storage and other accommodating features like civilians side droids jewels and more connecting everything together are all important parts of the ecosim and will be detailed in later announcements okay so now we get to resources whether you want to deliver and share an experience play fully immersed inside the virtual world which is e2v1 with digital assets and items display ads promote external games sell physical goods via digital storefronts uh share a link to external experiences or create buildings uh or other sorry or create other General web one e-commerce products or Services you're going to need buildings and infrastructure of some sort so in order to do that you need these buildings inside of Earth too right so the ecosim players you guys are providing the infrastructure for other types of experiences to come in and utilize your infrastructure in order to deliver their products their storefront um you know display their ads whatever it may be now I mean this is obviously something I could have said look yeah I'm going to be we're going to be really greedy here and Earth is going to control all of these aspects I don't want to do that I want the players to be involved I want the players to create the infrastructure much like we have in the real world I'm sitting in a skyrise building right now uh I don't own the building but we lease space in the building um it's just I don't know how the building was built I can't go and I can't design uh you know I can't do all the engineering for the building I can't uh I can't do the architectural design I can't ensure the building is safe whatever I can't do that but that's what the ecosim players will kind of do inside of Earth too and provide an environment for others to come in we'll you know will it be buzzing tomorrow I don't know but this is a long term uh vision and kind of plan that we have here and that we're working on so it's step by step okay where was I up to Fair would you say oh yeah well I mean and how would you get all of these foundational facilities like the buildings and infrastructure well it all starts with resources you need resources in a to be able to do this thus resources are a fundamental component of the ecosim kickstarting local and Global Supply chains taking real world attributes to enable the creation of objects within our Earth 2 geolocational metaverse just like the real world there will be many resources in Earth too and multiple stages and ways to discover replicate and craft them into building blocks for a multitude of different purposes most recently we've seen Silver and copper resources which were released for players to claim on their properties and stake Essence via our Earth 2 player resource validation system so 21 additional resources will now follow and progressively be released via e2prv for claiming on uh on a one resource per one to two week schedule as I said earlier probably one to two weeks um you know if things are flowing nicely we'll get into a one-week schedule maybe even shorter but we'll see after the first new resource is revealed so that new resource hasn't been revealed yet but when the first ones revealed you know that that procedure has started all resources in Earth 2 will have utility via the ecosim and will be required to craft building blocks for future ecosim assets and many other types of objects the discovery tiers for these confirmed resources and their respective Prime Jewels are listed below so you guys will be able to see um you know maybe it'll be up on the screen here at the moment but you'll be able to see a list that we've compiled showing the different types of resources or images of the different types of you'll notice that we've got like D1 D2 D3 these are Discovery tiers so you've got Discovery tier one you've got Discovery tier two you've got Discovery tier three and so on um so that will provide an indication of what the different Discovery tiers are and those Discovery tiers are important um for the way that well you'll find out about lab it's just a way that prospecting side roads work and a number of other things so the higher Discovery tiers will probably be fewer and far between more rarer and serve various purposes so another thing you can note here is that we're displaying we are displaying all the jewels that will Prime these resources so we're laying it out on the table obviously one of the things we want to do long term is add more and more utility to joules and all their different tier levels so we've laid out we've showed which joules are associated with the resources you'll see the little lock signs under the resources they're the ones that we'll be revealing over the next 20 weeks now there are some I know opal there's some jewels that are not in this list but they will be used for other purposes or other types of resources this isn't the final resource list there'll be more resources released in the future and the and those Jewels I'm not sure how many of them might be eight or something but however many jewels there are that we haven't used here will be utilized in other areas um the jewels have also received an important update to align their look and feel more closely with the primary resource there now associated with the new look the new look still follows the previous colour scheme but has the added benefit of being able to accommodate for future planned utilities so resources will be critical for any kind of progression in the ecosim and we anticipate they will be highly traded

the previous colour scheme but has the added benefit of being able to accommodate for future planned utilities so resources will be critical for any kind of progression in the ecosim and we anticipate they will be highly traded assets inside of Earth 2 in terms of volume so when we say resources we mean you know the raw materials of the resources which comes from the occurrence units which will learn a little bit more down more below so with the initial release of resources several related gameplay features will intentionally be excluded in order to provide a simpler more accessible Early Access version to players on the current Earth 2 web version these excluded features will gradually be introduced especially in e2v1 altering the mechanics and significantly increasing the complexity of resource Discovery and Acquisitions over times so an example of these components scheduled for later release inside of e201 are like localized inventories and logistic requirements so we might cheat for a little bit depending on how things go a little bit similar to how we've done things with jewels and we're probably going to be doing with side droids and civilians where players are going to be able to kind of instantly transfer those to each other that is a short term we look at it internally as like a short-term cheat for us long term they're all going to be part of the logistics system so if you want if you want to move jewels from A to B you're going to have to move them logistically if you want a civilian to go from A to B, Logistics that's how the whole of E2 is going to work so there'll be short-term cheats that's what that's explaining here is short-term cheats but long term just be aware that we are going to be moving to this really cool open global ecosm Logistics mechanics inside of e2v1 so it's important to remember that there will be gameplay activities to suit everyone in Earth 2 from players to Holders to Everyday users the resource system is one of many different gameplay Pathways that players may choose to explore and specialize in finding an area of interest in Earth 2 is key to a fund successful and rewarding player experience however most if not all paths within earth 2 will start easy and progressively become more difficult to master enabling anyone to experiment and explore this type of gameplay pathway empowers anyone to improve their stats and expand their virtual pro portfolio by yielding higher rewards the more they choose to invest time and Implement Advanced strategies inside the ecosim so that's what I was touching on before the Earth 2 is not designed for one specific type of player you see people jump up and down and say oh my goodness this Eco this rating is so complicated oh civilians are so complicated now they need red energy to live my goodness what are we going to do that's the most confusing thing I've ever heard in my life but at the end of the day there are different aspects of Earth 2 that are going to appeal to different people the end goal doesn't change we're still creating a massive open 3D geolocational metaverse a world that players can jump in and explore and you'll notice that a lot of those players who you know they might not like the ecosim which is fine but a lot of those players who um who are saying now this is super complicated once each everyone opens and you drop your avatar in there it's like okay cool I can I can do this I can run around and do that I can explore this I can find this I can you know I can do all of these things that are going to be quite engaging so yeah that's what this this uh paragraph is covering uh so discover okay we'll answer the next section discovering and obtaining resources so most resources on Earth too will be situated deep underground much like resources in the real world as ether evaporates from the ground it carries with it the binary data of resources present in the land this binary data is measured in occurrence units the binary data contained within the ether is not easily interpreted by the mentor which is only able to do it weekly is only able to weakly read the occurrence units of Discovery Tier 1 resources so that's that D1 Discovery tier one resources so refer to that image above whilst it is collecting an evaporated uh the evaporated ether to do this Prime joules for the corresponding resources are required to be slotted into the mentor so even to be able to do that as we've said from day one you need to slot the prime jewels from the corresponding resource into your mentor to be able to for the mentor to even weekly discover the occurrence units this enables the binary data to flow through and the occurrence units to be deciphered by the mentor from the various binary data strings while the mentor is able to read the binary data occurrence units contained in in The Ether its reading capabilities are very poor and much of the data is lost in The Ether collection process so from there enter prospecting side droids so due to the inefficient reading capabilities of the mentor alternative methods for decoding the binary data had to be innovated in order to access higher Discovery tiers of resources and to optimize reading efficiency readers would soon discover that Raiders Side Road Raiders would soon discover that their raid side droids could be modified by fusing Prime Jewels into them that's fusing burning into them which allow them to read binary data owing to the intrinsic side Droid technology already enabling them to detect and capture ether so the side Droid will still be able to raid but this fusing of the jewel itself in the side drag gives the Sidra this additional ability many attempts using prime jewels to re-engineer the raid side droids did fail and it was quickly noted that each side Droid type had a dual colour it could be successfully fused with depending on the tier and quality of the Prime Jewel The Raid side Droid was fused with uh it and the process was Garen was granted chances of allowing more dedicated resource slots so fusing a brilliant drill gave the additional perks of more power cell slots and other benefits are still unknown so just quickly on the brilliant side the brilliant Jewel we want to continue adding obviously cool perks for Brilliance um I think there'll be more than what's listed here for what the what a fusing a brilliant Jewel could do and I'm not sure exactly how that will work so take that as with a grain of slope but with a grain of salt but what we're saying here is when you fuse your when you fuse your cydroid with one of these jewels you actually get the chance to there's a random chance for opening up depending I think on the quality of the jewel there's a random chance of actually opening up permanent slots on your Jewel specific for the ecosim resource the resource aspect of Earth 2. uh the successfully modified side roads were able to implement the reading technology far better than the mentor itself however each side Droid type was only specialized in discovering and reading one specific type of resource reading and capturing a resource occurrence unit occurs at the point of ether collection extracting the occurrence units data directly into the side droids memory Prime Jewels were proven necessary to modify raid side droids granting the additional function of prospecting to read resource occurrence units and at a higher more accurate rate than the mentor so these prospecting side droids once fused they can when they collect The Ether they can uh they're much more efficient at reading the occurrence units and Gathering those for you so you can still get those you know those D1 uh you know you can still use the mentor for those d1s at a weaker level to

The Ether they can uh they're much more efficient at reading the occurrence units and Gathering those for you so you can still get those you know those D1 uh you know you can still use the mentor for those d1s at a weaker level to get those occurrence unit and manufacture raw materials but these uh prospecting side roads That's Where It's At if you want them the best kind of result or the highest possible uh reading of the occurrence units uh results from early experimentation also revealed that the additional resource slots obtained could support supplementary Jewels enhancing the effects of the fused Prime Jewel through this experimentation of cydroid modifications and Dual Fusion the blueprints of the prospecting cydroid were invented it quickly became clear that prospecting cydroids would be a key to discovering higher Discovery tier resources on player-owned land as the demand for prospecting side droids increased the later prospecting Tigers were manufactured and built for purpose rather than modified from existing raid side roads however these purpose-built prospecting side droids would not have the ability to raid thus creating many new potential scenarios for landowners to consider so manual so we're talking now about these manufactured prospecting side droids one thing we don't want to do is in inside of Earth 2 and I've you know I talk about this with game design one thing we don't we always want to add a kind of a grind version where players can kind of grind away and still make their way through the ecosim without being something to purchase things from other players on trade but we want to try and add ways of players can still grind through themselves so here we're saying okay you've got these ethereal side Droids that can raid right you fuse them you confuse them with jewels and unlock new abilities for them which is the prospecting Side Road collecting occurrence units and what have you now that starts to expand the utility on these side Droids that can raid and Prospect and you know probably and well not probably but other things that were going to real reveal in the future but you also have this ability to manufacture these side droids but these side droids they won't have the ability to raid they only have one ability which is to uh you know get this get this higher level um these high level discovery because you remember the mentor can only get the D1 so if you want like d2345 whatever it is you're going to need side droids to be able to gather those occurrence units so what this manufacturing prospecting side Droid does is uh you know you won't require a jewel to be fused on it but you got to manufacture it so as it's noted here it says however manufacturing prospecting side droids from scratch requires quite a bit of substantial or quite a substantial amount of raw material and building blocks instead so prospecting side roads with lower Rarity require less raw material when manufactured so what we're saying here is that each type of Side Road can be replicated for its future for its future um uses in in most cases for its future utility however the rarer so you know if you've got a legendary or you know whatever a legendary might be able to do for example in the future um they're going to be super like much harder to manufacture you're going to need a lot of things to manufacture them and then they still won't be the same as a legendary they won't be able to raid and they're they might only be able to do one thing of when a legendary can do 10 different things for example so you still have the Rarity on the side droids as they sit right now is still effective uh and that's going to be expanded over time but players will still have the ability to kind of manufacture those to do single kind of utility items out of the from the Ethereal side Droids that we have today hopefully that makes sense um but what that does is like for example you know a lot of these low-level uh like the lower kind of D2 D3 or D1 prospecting side droids they'll they should be uh they could be produced by lower level resources as well okay let's move on to improve their strategies landowners were faced with more decisions such as whether the prospecting raid side roads should be sent to other properties to raid ether and obtain foreign occurrence units or be kept on their own property to collect and read their own occurrence units and if these side roads were to remain on the property then should it be the mentor or the prospecting raid side Droid that collects The Ether beyond the questions of how occurrence units should be obtained landowners would also need to decide which resources to prioritize so we're really starting to open up a lot of different strategies if you I don't know if you guys got that paragraph but basically what we're saying is that once you have these prospecting side droids you can send them to raid other player properties if that player has that has that resource on their properties you can actually when you're rating their ether if you're successful you can be gathering occurrence units of their uh that Resource as well and their property and bringing it back to your uh property uh for collection and processing so it really starts to open up a lot of different strategies that that players will need to think about given that occurrence unit reading occurs at the point of The Ether collection landowners would also need to decide the amount of ether and which resources would be targeted by the mentor and uh and each of the prospecting side droids so experimenting with different strategies is key for land owners to discover what works best for them like for example you just you're gonna aim for more ether by having the mentor that is packed with ether boosting Jewels collect more ether or less prospecting cydroids collect ether to prioritize resource yield these are all going to be different aspects that the ecosm plan needs to consider uh daily ether brings with it new occurrence units to extract to extract once the binary data is extracted the prospecting cydroid will be required to dispense the collected ether to the global balance of The Ether and occurrence units to be accounted for ether and occurrence units collected by the mentor will immediately be accounted for without the need to dispense okay frequency and occurrence units most players will already be aware that resources are distributed in certain areas with high HF high frequency or unknown frequency and that these frequency categories are signed per property the actual distribution of resources will occur in the near future where each land tile will be assigned a frequency per resource for example a 750 tile property will have a frequency assigned to each of the individual 750 Tulsa every single tile inside that property will have its own unique attribute of which resource it has furthermore players will be able to see five frequency category frequency categories deficient sparse moderate rich and copious being the highest or you know the latter the copious being what is currently known as high frequency a property will always be assigned a dominant frequency for example copious frequency but the individual tiles making up the property will still have their own frequency categories assigned to them and potentially even a few tiles with no resource for frequency at all in other words a property that has been assigned copious frequency of a resource will still consist of tiles that each range from no frequency all the way up to copious and a property that has been assigned moderate frequency for a resource will consist of tiles at each range from no frequency to moderate frequency

that each range from no frequency all the way up to copious and a property that has been assigned moderate frequency for a resource will consist of tiles at each range from no frequency to moderate frequency only while a property that is copious will not likely consist of tiles which are all assigned to copious frequency they will still have more occurrence units in the ground than a property of a lower frequency category for now landowners can see if a resource exists on their property neither the precise frequency category nor the occurrence unit information will be available initially except for those whose properties have been assigned HF high frequency also known as copious frequency players will be able to discover different resource Discovery tiers by participating in the E2 prv scheme claiming which is claiming to unveil the frequency of resources attributed to their properties however prospecting side droids may have the ability to discover resources in the future as well the ability to access occurrence units insights requires the employment of a geologist civilian which is yet to be released obviously as most of the stuff that we're talking here is yet to be we're talking about here is yet to be released so although it is possible to replicate resources via the Weaver without knowing the occurrence units to optimize the replication process is highly recommended to synthesize uh geologist civilian to gain access to these insights uh see geologist civilian is one of the new civilians for the future and regarding the Weaver and replication process there's more information here below so let's look at the read process which is yielding occurrence units the qualities of occurrence units contained within the evaporated ether fluctuate on a daily basis this volatility can be stabilized and increased by using joules to boost the read quality of the reader prospecting cydroid or mentor of a particular resource as each prospecting Droid will need to collect its own ether and filter and read the binary data through the slotted Prime Jewel it will it may be quite difficult to extract the amount of daily occurrence units as a resource to attempt it a land owner would need to allow the prospecting Side Road to collect all the ether as well as boost the reading quality with the optimal configured configuration of slotted jewels landowners owning modified red side droids are also able to obtain occurrence units from other players properties as I mentioned earlier by rating their ether when using a prospecting cydroid able to discover the resources that exist within the target property the collected occurrence units data must either be immediately used in the Weaver for resource replication or stored in Hollow buildings for later use and we'll get to some more details on that below players will also have the option to improve a prospecting side droid's reading ability by directly injecting Essence into the power cell of the cydroid while it is recharging thereby creating a temporary boost effect enabling the side road to consume extract more recurrence unit data than what it was actually and then what was actually present in the ground this temporary effect requires Essence to be irreversibly consumed strategy and balancing mechanics are involved while utilizing this type of boost and will be further elaborated in a future announcement so what it's saying there is that you will be able to kind of overcharge or boost your side droids with additional Essence that gets burned uh if you really want like a you need resources fast and you want to you want to pump up that uh occurrence unit data proximate understanding of the daily ability availability of occurrence units and cubic meters players must train a civilian in geological knowledge the geologist furthermore by equipping the geologist skill to the side Droid ether reckoner players can unlock the new Mastery head reckoner granting the insights of occurrence units and cubic meters when yielding the resources from the ground and how much is stored in the hollow building storages adding the geologist skill to the raw material tailor managing the Weaver grants insights into how long time the replication process will take and how much cubic meters it will result in this allows players to gain valuable information about the resource present in the ground yielded by the prospects droids mentor and stored in the hollow buildings and replication outcomes of the Weaver it is important to note that without their geologist skill in these areas players can still perform the necessary processes but they won't have access to the specific quantity information each step in advance okay so just before I continue as I noted at the start of this I'm just I'm reading through the announcement and trying to give some insights as I go through the announcement this is just to help people out who either don't like reading through the announcement they just want to hear it and also other ecosim players who would like to hear some of my ideas and insights and a little bit of additional information as I'm reading through sorry that I'm gonna I'm looking down here and reading it going through and giving these insights but I'm just so busy at the moment I don't have time to prepare and do a real proper presentation so apologies for that so now let's go on to hollow building storage all Hollow buildings have the ability to store resource occurrence units players who already have hollow buildings built on their properties will have occurrence units already stored when resources launch so this will go up to 1000 cubic meters of hollow building space per property is eligible for the retroactive occurrence units reward and each cubic meter has the capacity to store a certain amount of occurrence units which is yet to be disclosed but from what I understand this will be quite significant and give players who have been dedicated to placing those Hollow buildings a pretty good Head Start of retroactive occurrence units going into going into storage so good on you guys for getting ahead however the occurrence unit storage capacity will not be restricted to 1000 in cubic meters of hollow building space once occurrence units are released and actively yielded players May opt to construct more space to increase the occurrence Unix storage capacity of their buildings at this point in time and Beyond the hollow building storage capacity is local to the property and occurrence units cannot be transferred to other properties this is very important and this plays into the whole ecosim Logistics Global kind of ecosystem that we're building detached Hollow buildings will still act as one local storage for the property any cubic meter existing on the property is totalled up to the properties total occurrence unit storage capacity once the occurrence units are in the properties local reserve the player will be able to see how many occurrence or how much occurrence unit space that is stored and remains as well as the amount of cubic meters would equate to if running that through the Weaver running those occurrence units through the Weaver removing an already constructed Hollow building from a property could risk the players local storage capacity to go below what is required for the amount of occurrence units already stored in this instance where the local storage drops below the amount of occurrence units currently stored the equivalent amount of occurrence units in the storage space will be removed and discarded likewise if the maximum storage local capacity is reached and more current units are attempted to be deposited these occurrence units will immediately be blocked so if you've got a warehouse if you've

the storage space will be removed and discarded likewise if the maximum storage local capacity is reached and more current units are attempted to be deposited these occurrence units will immediately be blocked so if you've got a warehouse if you've got something storing occurrence units and you knock it down whatever's in that whatever's inside that is also going to be lost the head reckoner which is an upgraded uh an upgraded version of The Ether reckoner will play a crucial role for players to gain insights on their local storage capacity to ensure they maintain enough storage space for the occurrence units that they wish to collect and I believe the head reckoner also has something to do with helping higher level Discovery resources be in the occurrence units be interpreted I'm not sure if that's in here or not and I hope I'm not incorrect in saying that but that's just what I remember okay the replication process of raw materials and cubic meters collected occurrence unit data can be imported into the Weaver and used to create physical raw material this is better known as the replication process this is this is where we're getting with uh We've detected the uh the resource occurrence units through the evaporated ether it's been collected by either the mentor for D1 or the prospecting side droids for like D1 two through whatever it's been detected extracted now we're getting to the fun part where you you've got these occurrence units and you're actually creating that physical raw material that's then going to be used inside of the building blocks and different aspects uh to you know create buildings and whatnot so that raw material sometimes it might be logistically easier to move the raw material and have a building block Factory use that raw material at a different location or maybe you've got a good setup on your property you get the remote material out manufactured to building blocks and then move it um so but anyway this whole process is better known as a replication process in contrast to the reading process the Weaver is not able to replicate raw materials instantly the capacity of a weaver to replicate raw materials within a 24-hour period is determined by the Weaver's run time including the required cool down time and production space both the runtime and the production Pace can be improved and optimized over time the base level Weaver can only replicate one resource at a time and the player will need to prioritize which raw materials to produce first in the future it will become possible to build more Weavers to further increase raw material production and enable different raw materials to be replicated simultaneously Prime Jewels are once again key to unlocking replication as the process involves the occurrence units to flow through the prime Jewel of the corresponding resource in order to print the desired raw material to optimize the Weaver's replication Pace a player will need to reconfigure the Weaver with different combinations of joules which in turn boost the resource production so you hear Jules joules jewels utility Jewels this reconfiguration between raw material Productions can be done manually or with the help of the raw material Taylor civilian Ortho Auto reconfiguring the Weaver the raw material Taylor will be able will enable insights on how long of time or how much time a resource will take to replicate and how much cubic meters will be the result in that replication the Weaver's replication technology is Advanced resulting in Long cooldowns a small operational team of civilians can be employed to learn the production process and utilize the Weaver's full replication capacity as a civilian team gains more experience with replicating a particular resource they will naturally learn how that resource behaves when being printed and optimizes the Weaver runtime for the resource using them using this knowledge and experience now just before we move on you guys want to you guys wanted details you wanted information you're screaming for ecosystem information here it all is there's so much here okay storing and selling raw materials in cubic meters when resources finally take their physical form through the replication process they will occupy a certain amount of cubic meter space at the beginning of the ecosystem this capacity to store raw materials will be quite limited inside the initial buildings once progressing in the ecosm the player can decide to expand this storage uh to the to their required levels raw materials will be traded tradable in the bizarre Logistics will be a key requirement for transporting raw materials to buyers so as I said inside e2v1 there may be players inside e2v1 who are just solely focused on moving and transporting focused on the logistics of moving things around so you might have a specialization in moving gold around or coal or you might cover a lot of different things you might have a special route from uh from America to England or France to Italy or uh you know South Africa to the Australian West Coast um or the spice trade route I don't know through China and India you might you might be specialized in certain areas people might players might want something but they're not too worried about how long it takes and then they'll opt for kind of Cheaper Transportation or less whatever or you might even be a mogul and you'll have you have it all yourself you have civilians uh powering and moving things around you might be a player who's just starting out and you want to physically move things around uh inside of e2v1 to get yourself ahead so yeah it's really it's really quite exciting on um the information that is shared here it gives a really good initial insight into how things will work obviously there's other levels that will uh disclose over time but hopefully what players get out of this is just a very a step-by-step understanding of the initial process on how resources work how they how they get detected how they move from detection into storage either storage or direct manufacturing so and then how they those occurrence you know they move through the Dual the prime Jewel into the Weaver into a raw material which can then be used as that that foundational physical resource or that material that can go into building blocks or other things that that are required so there are a few q and A's that will be added to the to the bottom here I won't go through those now I think this video is going to be long enough so um hopefully that helps some people understand hopefully that makes it a little bit easier also some of my insights hopefully that's of interest to some people if you guys like this format I am so I'm so busy all the time however if you guys like this format let me know I'll try and make it a more common thing where I can go through an article give some feedback and thoughts uh reading through the article let me know I'll try and make more of an effort to do that um if not you know I'll just keep my head down and we'll just keep pushing forward uh hopefully for the Eco Sim players out there this is interesting uh it I know it sounds like a lot of information when but when you boil it down it really is just that process and uh yeah I'll team will ensure that that's a really you know it's a nice process to follow per property and that civilians will be part of automating that process um after it's set up so anyway hope you guys like that there's probably a million other things that I could mention or talk about at the moment but I won't start going down new rabbit holes and good to see you guys again I know it's been a little while just so many things going on take care uh for those of you in the northern hemisphere enjoy your summer holidays good weather good times and look forward to seeing you all again soon goodbye hey guys before I go I just wanted to touch on one important aspect that I didn't quite cover in the

or talk about at the moment but I won't start going down new rabbit holes and good to see you guys again I know it's been a little while just so many things going on take care uh for those of you in the northern hemisphere enjoy your summer holidays good weather good times and look forward to seeing you all again soon goodbye hey guys before I go I just wanted to touch on one important aspect that I didn't quite cover in the previous video one of the other reasons for setting up these uh these resources and buildings and factories and what have you is that as a player you're going to be able to manufacture a lot of the digital items accessories and objects inside of Earth too so you could even focus on for example being a ship manufacturer or like a flying car manufacturer obviously the more advanced the vehicles or products are the harder they are to manufacture but then at the end of the day once they are manufactured you can sell them to a wider group of players so there may be players who don't play the Eco Sim but want a nice car for example the future that I see of Earth 2 is to provide a way for players to be able to produce these digital items and sell them directly to the player a little bit kind of different from the traditional game industry standard where everything is completely created by the game provider themselves and they're the ones who other and beneficiary of selling those items so I just thought I'd add that it's quite interesting I think it's pretty cool that all of the content or all of the items inside of us to will have touched players at some point in time through the ecosim and the byproduct which will be a kind of I guess it's a capitalist Market where players there'll be a dictation of price depending on supply and demand but I just think the end goal is pretty cool where you can actually focus on manufacturing something and then have a market the end user just the probably the average player inside of Earth to who wants something that you've created so I just thought I'd add that some food for thought and that is part of the long-term goal here so those eco-sim players who focus on playing the ecosim will have the ability to also create factories that can manufacture specific types of vehicles or objects even going as far as clothing and accessories and things like that so uh I don't know I don't know if it

Transcript 3.docx","chunkIndex":0,"content":"Earth 2 - Resource Validation Rewards, Auto-Validation + Responding to Random Discord Comments Shane Isaac:“Hey guys hope you're doing well and that you have been keeping safe welcome back to another candid video where I just share various thoughts on some of the things that are presently happening inside of earth 2. the first thing that I wanted to talk about quickly is the resource validation system that we have upcoming to be released next month through June this resource validation system as we've alluded to will give benefits to players who successfully validate resources on their property which they believe exist on their property but have not been for whatever reason detected by our systems so I’ll just give a very quick rundown on how this will work a player will have the opportunity to submit a validation other players will have the opportunity to I guess validate or support that submission of the resource request validation request now a player who submits the validation for resources they can in fact also support their own request when you support a request you stake essence now there'll be a lit a certain limit of essence that can be staked on every request and we're hoping that the way that we well the way that we are going to structure it will allow for multiple people to be involved with validating a request but one of the people or players who are validating the request can be the actual person or player who submitted the validation themselves if the validation is successful they will get back bonus essence on top of what they staked on the request or the validation so I’ll give you a quick scenario let's say that I I’m a player I’ve got tiles in a certain country I believe I have a gold mine that is located on where my tiles are at and it's not showing up on the earth to resource heat map yet therefore I go and submit a request to have these resources validated I obviously believe strongly in my request and I stake essence you know 100 essence or something like that I stake essence to validate that request because I’m supporting my own request other players can also come in and stake essence up to a certain amount per property once that property is validated to in fact have that resource if it is if it is all correct every player who staked their essence in that validation will get back a higher percentage you know it could be 20 30 could be 50 percent they will get a higher amount of essence versus what they staked now there have also been questions about players validating resources in the same area there might be a player or players who have tiles there are associated to the same gold mine or the same location for oil or whatever it may be in this situation you really need to stake your request to validate the resources as early as possible if you want to get that bonus essence for successfully validating or requesting resources on the property what this means is that let's say that player one has gone in there they've got a property that's on a gold mine they've submitted a request to validate that gold mine once that validation goes through once the gold mine becomes validated by our team not in all cases but in many cases what we will do is cast a net over any other existing validations in that direct area so we can grant the validation for all of those in the same area so if you do not have an active request in place you will get that resource when it's validated if your property falls within the area that we grant the resource permission to the permission for the resource to exist however if you do not have a that request in place with essence stake you won't get the essence bonus because of this we plan to allow probably like a week at least for players to get in and submit their validations on properties that they believe have the resource that they're requesting in in the first instance like gold oil whatever it may be in the future so we'll give that buffer zone probably a week or so to players to be able to make sure that their request is in place however after that weeks’ time if that resource gets validated on a property we're going to cast the net and say okay all these other properties in the area will automatically get it if you have an existing request in place and essence staked you'll automatically receive that essence bonus once just one property is validated in that area what this obviously helps us to do is the system that we're building is that we can validate places and include multiple validation requests in one approval as opposed to us going through thousands hundreds thousands of approvals at the same time so we kind of cast the net and validate a whole group but if you don't have your request in place you'll miss the essence bonus but not the resource itself hope that makes sense so a couple of weeks ago I asked some of my team members to have a look through discord and just take screenshots of things that sounded interesting or statements that were interesting and the purpose behind that is just to collect some interesting thoughts from the community which I can then incorporate into my video here my candid thoughts giving me something to talk about which people are actually actively requesting information on I’m not sure if this is going to happen every time so just spamming questions in discord might not end up in this might not be give a guarantee that it's going to end up here in the in the list of questions but it's just something we thought to do so I’m going to go through some statements and questions from the discord now I’m going to give my thoughts and feedback on those questions progressively and I hope this works let's see how it goes so I’m just going to read the questions off my screen and then talk about it so we've got a question from Jad and sorry if I pronounce anybody's username handle incorrectly I can't help but notice on these vlogs where they show a property the buildings are never on an outer tile will our buildings have to remain at least one tile from the property's edge this would mean the smallest buildable property is nine tiles and that's a great observation so in the vlogs that we show they're just they're just examples of properties I wouldn't take too seriously what the border is or you know how many tiles are on the border but it is a valid question because you know we're all thinking about road systems and how the road system is going to function inside like a village or a city or a mega city or whatever it may be or even just a small cluster of buildings so what I can answer quickly on this is that the tiles that we're showing in the vlogs up until even the vlog that we're going to release shortly they are based on like a proper 10 by 10 meter square tile however that is not the actual size of what the tiles will be inside of earth 2. so the size will be somewhat bigger so I think it's maybe the vlog not the next vlog but maybe the one after or the one after that where we are going to display how the road system will work inside of inside of an earth to city or when properties are in close vicinity with one another or proximity to one another we're going to show how that system works and what you'll see is that the tiles and they will be this will be synonymous across all of the tiles inside of earth 2 the tile sizes are somewhat larger you know this will allow for the building size to remain quite similar to what we've been demoing but it will allow a perimeter around the tile that will be used in a special way to allow navigation within properties that have close proximity and build these kind of internal road systems inside of the city so

Transcript 3.docx","chunkIndex":1,"content":"ile that will be used in a special way to allow navigation within properties that have close proximity and build these kind of internal road systems inside of the city so interesting question hope that answers gives you like answer an answer or something to think about for now and I’ll have a look at the next question okay the next question here is from futuristic and futuristic says what's the point of merging if you can just buy a 750 they mean he means like he or she means a 750 tile property people have plenty of those um so this is about merging tiles so the questions being asked if you have such a large property why would you want to merge it and uh reedbird from virtual-buzzword answers and he answers correctly I’m assuming it's a him because he's got a profile photo that looks male and yeah he's saying it's for the people who have bought one tile farms and this has been a thing where players have bought one tile properties to farm whatever it may be joules or whatever they're doing there they've got their own little strategy so yes to have certain types of eco sim setups inside of earth 2 you do need a few tiles like whatever 10 tiles 5 tiles whatever it may be what we've done is or what we're working on is giving the player the ability to merge their tiles together for this exact reason if they want to expand on their property if they need to make it a little bit bigger to facilitate something that they decided to grow or that they decided to build toward which their property cannot handle at the moment then they at least have the ability to do that and for you know these one-tile property farms that are right next to each other at least give them the ability to be able to merge their properties should they wish to and I’m not going to go into all the merging of properties now and you know what that's going to involve I know a lot of people talk about it possibly involving essence and you know costing something we haven't got all of those plans laid down just yet and yeah I can see ebvk responds to that and says uh I don't think you realize just how big a one by 750 tile property is let alone two so that's very true a 750 tile property is quite significant it's massive and I don't think we would want people merging multiple 750 tile properties and we have a statement here from Mr green who has a bot tick so Mr green must be confirmed as a bot Mr green says I feel for us to get millions if not tens of millions of people involved in this and playing it that the crypto aspect needs to be made easy or they need to put out some detailed instructions on how to do it and this is another this is this is a good point um the way that we're looking to set up our crypto strategy our token so to speak will be quite straightforward we want to we want to have a bridge between the internal earth 2 system and the web 3 exchanges or wherever players might be able to trade their token the token obviously being essence so we'll have a system where the token can remain inside of earth 2 and be used for utility and purpose inside of the earth 2 metaverse but when we want to make it as easy as possible when a player wants to take that token out and you know take it to an exchange to trade it or do whatever they want with it because that's their right they've earned that token we want to make that process as simple as possible I know a lot of players are talking about custodial and non-custodial and we probably will be going like a non-custodial route but it would be we will be doing a lot of the leg work for the player so the player and those who don't understand crypto very well and wallets and how they function will we will be kind of hand-holding um doing a lot of hand-holding for those players that that want to take their essence out of earth to and go and trade it so yes it's a good statement it's a good point and it is important for us to really um you know supply those detailed instructions or make it as easy as possible and that's definitely what we're planning to do we got another one here from Mr green the bot um and he says Shane I’m not going to merge my singles it would mess up the heat map art so don't screw me over and at least make them useful somehow so yeah I mean it's a it is a funny statement and uh that but it's true like it's something that we need to consider is the tie light really um the heat map or the tile art and merging them together in some cases would mean that the tie light would become uh yeah it might become obscured so this is something that we are thinking about from a flag perspective this is something that we're thinking about um I guess from a heat map perspective it's going to be much of a much just like you bought the single tiles to get a benefit a short-term benefit of farming more jewels you will have the option to merge those single tiles if you would like to use those tiles to play or be part of the you know a larger eco sim um have larger ecosystem set up so you will have that option at least and better than not having that option but I agree like from a tie light perspective at the moment the recent upgrade we made allows every property to have a separate flag but if you know if you've got tile up with a lot of single properties and those single properties obviously have different flags on them for you to be able to you know display your tie light which is which is awesome I understand merging them together would remove the ability for that tie light to be to be displayed so what I’m looking at in this area to avoid people losing out on the Thailand it's not higher the importance or the agenda right now it's not a high priority however we are looking at allowing players to inside one single property change the flags on each and every single tile so you could have like a 100 tile property and you can select which type of flag you want to fly on each property and this might be like a different filter in where that shows because the purpose really for the flags is to show you know which country that that player is affiliating their property to and that is important long term so we are kind of balancing things here that's just a quick little bit of feedback on how that might be handled and I hope that makes sense and yeah Chris replied to that one and said jewel farm guess that may be all they are useful for and then the don data did on data sorry d on data if I got that wrong yeah if merge means no tile art I’m out with singles too so yeah hopefully we can hopefully we can preserve that ability for Thailand because it is very creative I love the toilet and I don't want to don't want to release something that's going to um you know rule all the time light out today okay we have a message here from drew and happy birthday drew hope you're having a great birthday uh so drew says clicking transform is not a good way to get essence going to each property or something similar when we get more gameplay is definitely coming Shane said it will be more difficult which is good news another reason that as time goes by many of us have far too many properties to handle on our own I’m definitely looking forward to hearing more about scholars so yeah it's a great comment drew and when drew refers to scholars he's talking about basically our upcoming ability to contract your properties to ecosystem players so the players who do have a lot of properties it is going to be more and more difficult for that player to manage all of their properties just like it is in the real world and that player is going to have the ability to we're not calling it a scholar but you know they're going to have the ability to contract with other types of players as they will as

Transcript 3.docx","chunkIndex":2,"content":"ust like it is in the real world and that player is going to have the ability to we're not calling it a scholar but you know they're going to have the ability to contract with other types of players as they will as players will go on earth to throughout the whole course of the future of earth 2 will have different contracts for a lot of different things but in this case players who have a lot of properties will be able to contract eco sim players or you know people who are focused on playing the eco sim and that contract will then split whatever is produced inside of that property between the owner of the property and the ecosystem player who is responsible for managing that property if a contract is in place and yes that's a whole different rabbit hole I’m not going to go down into all of it now probably you know probably take a few long minutes to go into more detail but yeah well we'll have systems where players will have probably reviews of how good they are as an ecosim player making sure that property owners can connect with the right type of eco sim player and also like splits I guess if it's a new econ player maybe they get a lower split on the reward or whatever the produce of the properties that they look after to build a name for themselves so to speak and ecosystem players will be responsible for other things too like transportation and other things just you know jewels dual slotting maybe even dual crafting having some uh having a lot of knowledge in how the ecosim works will be very beneficial for eco sim players yeah we've got another quick comment here from Zac Friday I don't know if that's like a different way to say Friday but I’m just going to say Zach free day by the way will e2 in if it's successful in the future if have a virtual reality optional gameplay for those types of glasses which are being created and developed by big tech or will it be strictly for pc so that's a that's a great question Zach and I guess the quick the quick answer is yes so what we're building now at earth 2 is a is the visual platform and you know what we want to achieve in the future is for new hardware whether it be vr ar whatever it may be that it can connect to the visual platform the visual metaverse that we're building like for example we acquired drone the game you can put a you can put an oculus headset on right now you can play jump in to join the game and kind of feel what that what that's like um with an oculus headset on you can do that type of thing I think it's supported by steam what we're building enough to is this visual the visual kind of platform for what we see as the future of the metaverse becoming we're not building hardware and we're not building these additional you know haptic suits or whatever they may be that will become more and more important in the metaverse long term what we are doing is you know we want to be affiliated with those type of companies and we want to build visual a visual platform that allows those companies to connect their hardware into so hopefully that makes sense initially yet we'll be pc based and we're doing things in steps so we're trying to release interesting game loops or things for people to do inside the metaverse as we build toward this longer goal okay we've got another we've got another question here from or a statement from Simone s Simon s or I’d say Simone s so Simone says one thing I was thinking is I know the upcoming phase probably will just be temporary or it could work underneath the next phase as I really hope to walk around during phase three in a world not full of little technical buildings but more in nature or organized cities and small villages perhaps yeah so of course what we're building now will work as you said kind of under next than underneath the next phase it will become part of phase three this phase two this kind of phase 2.5 or this visual phase two that we're building it is the foundations for phase three phase three will come at some point in the future it'll be many years building up to that however what we're building now will be um will be important for phase three and of course like the world is massive they're so we've sell the fraction of a fraction of how many tiles there are available in the world there'll be a lot of nature a lot of trees a lot of places to go and explore as it is now and as it will be in the future that will always be part of the future and I’m sure that some people who own tiles they might not be into like the eco sim building they may just want to create some beautiful experience or you know create like a natural reserve or something like that so I’m sure that it's not all going to be just little tactical buildings full of technical buildings but you know the buildings that we'll be providing will you will be able to build them into like small villages or organized cities or mega cities whatever that may be and they will be you know some pretty cool amazing experiences there so we've got another comment here a really nice comment from Eugene boondock he said I just love how earth 2 is being built the 3d earth the grand metaverse think of the things being incorporated into earth 2 and exchange a mega market to sell and buy digital goods buildings drones etc a social media platform a virtual card Mastercard an open world paradise p versus p business strategies moving cargo resources defence system guilds Shane keeps his eyes on some of the vr glasses setups yeah I do it's gonna be wild and I don't know I just this this comment is very interesting and even in that short paragraph that Eugene has shared here you can start to see how many moving cogs there are to what we're building and sometimes it might feel like things are moving slow but that is also because there really are so many different cogs that we're working on and as those cogs come together you'll start to see the earth to metaverse really start to function and I guess people will start to realize what the potential and opportunities are inside of what we're building so we're happy with just focusing on building stuff at the moment we know we receive criticism from a lot of different places on things that we do in fact you know almost every little thing we do we get criticized for but we're happy just kind of focusing on these multiple areas that we're building we know we feel very confident that when these different areas or cogs come together it is going to be crazy it's going to be a really interesting place to visit the earth to metaverse a place to do things and a place to exist and a place to have your digital representation of yourself inside the metaverse and just looking at like these things that Eugene have listed here as I said you know like a massive open world you're going to have p verse p you're going to have you know business or economy ecosystem strategies you'll have cargo moving around everywhere you've got resources you're going to have to have defence systems you're going to have to have in many cases guilds you're going to have to be associated with people um other players in different ways so there are so many different things that are going to come together we're still getting there we're still building toward that but when it's when the pieces start connecting there'll be a lot of things to do so yeah thanks for a cool comment thanks Eugene we've got a comment here from aussie1 prime jewels plus hollow so that's pretty cool must be into jewels and hollow buildings and Ausie one says okay so resources can be woven without any ecosystem buildings constructed was the weaver part of the mentor so just to answer that quickly yes the weaver is

Transcript 3.docx","chunkIndex":3,"content":"gs and Ausie one says okay so resources can be woven without any ecosystem buildings constructed was the weaver part of the mentor so just to answer that quickly yes the weaver is included it is part it's an internal part of the mentor so yes you can have a mentor sitting on a tile that mentor has a weaver inside it that has the ability to weave the resources into raw materials or the detection of resources into raw materials limited building blocks can be held by each ecosim building before needing to be transported to local storage or transported away to be traded at a different location this sounds like there will be trading hubs my new theory is that that there will be added value of owning tiles in an earth to verified mega city they will be the only place where trades can happen now I mean interesting kind of theories that you have there which I which I thought was pretty cool I’m not sure if it's going to be limited to verified mega cities but yeah they will there will be trading hubs and what I would like to do what we're working on at the moment is that you know there will be specific buildings for these trading hubs and I don't know how much work will be involved in building a trading hub but I imagine um there will probably be some significant work involved in to play the eco-sim to be able to build a trading hub and they would be kind of places that players would strategically visit to trade in or do other things in so I just that comment was pretty cool and trading hubs the concept of trading hubs is very cool so I thought I’d just leave those few comments on that for now we have another one here from Ausie one uh transportation vehicles will have different attributes and suited best for specific activities theory is that jewels can also be used to improve these attributes heck it even said some transport vehicles will be designed for specific cargo types I’m thinking log truck for wood oil tanker for oil for this it would make sense that jewels of those specific colours would be used to boost them also maybe joules might be some sort of fuel source and that will allow a dual burn mechanic so yeah great theories again and I thought this is something I just comment on very quickly yes jewels will have multiple utility inside of earth too at the moment the main utility is obviously increasing the detection of ether and like sliding them on crafting and slotting them onto your mentor however they're going to have a lot more utility in many different areas and you'll probably find in the transport area is one of those in and many other areas I just wanted to confirm that okay so I guess this is probably taking a little bit of time now I’ll try and speed things up because I realize this is going to be a very long video uh wasn't intended to be but I don't often get a lot of time so I’m trying to just jump in and cram all this stuff into one session so I hope you guys could appreciate that and I’ll try and move through it as quickly as possible maybe there's just information throughout this video that some people find interesting should you have the time to look through it all realize that people are busy and they don't have the time to do that often in any case I’ve got a question here from Zeus that's Zeus from e2 news amazing website that they've created there and he says I have an interesting question does earth 2 rotate will it have light and darkness as hours pass and yeah I agree that's a super interesting question it's something that I’ve thought about quite a lot uh now in the initial version of e2v1 I’m not sure that version that whether or not we'd be implementing like a day night system but long term I do definitely want to have day night cycles whether or not there'd be multiple day night cycles in one day of earth two versus one day on earth one or another thing that I’ve considered is this is something that I’ve kind of am leaning toward is that we swap things around so if it's night in your country than its daytime in earth too and vice versa if it's daytime in your country it's not on earth too that would suggest that maybe people you know might be more prevalent to logging into earth to or tapping into earth to overnight time meaning that you know that it'll be daytime for them when they tap in now this is just something I’m considering nothing's final uh by all means like leave comments below about what your thoughts are on that or should we just have a system where days day and night is night the only issue I see with that is every time when people log in at night it's literally night in in earth 2 and I’m sure that people who have that spare time of an evening would also want to be experiencing some daylight so anyway if you guys have like interesting thoughts about how we could do that I’d love to hear them um by all means leave it in the comments below some people from my office read through the comments and I’m sure they'll let me know if there's anything interesting in there so please do okay we've got another question here from pacey of shoon city so cool pacey does a lot of good work by the way makes some amazing tutorials and videos on earth to love your work pacey and picking up a question or a statement from you here so I think the general conversation around this response that pace pacey wrote was like you know we need more people coming into earth who would you know we need to have more players which is true I mean and it will come and what pacey has said here is uh well we need more stuff for them to do first the big opportunities for land flipping jewel farms getting new country unlocks you know they're almost gone I mean a lot of people still do it there's people still playing every day and uh you know getting that that heads up leading into the future phases but um he goes on to say the next way the next way or that he means the next wave will be the free to play players or gamers and for the that we at least need the eco sim if they push big advertisement now they will come but they won't stay long I can see them doing a huge campaign once we do have it and this is this is a really uh you know it's a smart observation and it absolutely makes sense and that's what we're doing like there's no point in doing a big push right now where we don't you know when we don't have a lot to do inside of earth so especially in the with the 3d element game loops gamers are a notoriously difficult group to please you know they have high expectations for things and the gamers themselves are a notoriously difficult group to please at the best of times so the game is a one side but we will get we'll get players but they might not necessarily be gamers at first but we will have players and we'll have just everyday people interacting on earth too we want to open up I guess the 3d visualization of web 2 in a sense and we want people to start interacting in 3d as opposed to 2d that's one of our first goals but long term we need you know we need the we need the eco sim to be in place we need more game loops around there we need like 3d gameplay we need probably p verse p we need conflict we need more things to do inside of earth 2 before we do that massive push and you know doing that push too early will just be a complete waste of time and effort so at the moment we're happy building things and once we get closer to you know the eco sim the next wave or the next um group of interesting things to do on earth to it could come with the token launch or shortly after with e2 v1 and or a couple of other areas but when we see or feel that we're ready that's when we'll push and it won't be really until there's you

Transcript 3.docx","chunkIndex":4,"content":" launch or shortly after with e2 v1 and or a couple of other areas but when we see or feel that we're ready that's when we'll push and it won't be really until there's you know interesting things to do and you know conflict and p verse p and stuff like that so good observation and I just wanted to add a couple of comments to that we have another comment here from Ausie one and Ausie one said what do we think houses shops transportation stations skyscrapers educational facilities and social hubs will do for the eco-sims specifically so great question and I guess these buildings will perform similar functions to what their titles say so you know you've got houses that's like residential these will be customizable personal spaces for earth to for earth 2 players to own and kind of set up their own individual private area that they could display their 3d goods they can customize have their friends over and what have you so that you know houses shops same commercial experience if you want to have a shop inside of earth 2 you're going to have to interact with the ecosystem to some extent and build a shop that can be a commercial shop and you know you can provide your own commercial experience or you can link to a commercial experience that may not necessarily be directly inside of earth too transportation stations yes so vehicles transportation going to be big things inside of earth 2 moving goods around moving digital goods moving raw materials and building blocks and things like that and many other types of things so transportation stations may come in may be important during those times skyscrapers again like office buildings commercial experiences in fact you'll probably see a little bit about that uh in the vlog that we're the next vlog that we're going to release um educational facilities so again like there'll be some teasers in the next vlog that were released but you know I won't say anything just watch the next vlog but educational facilities they'll you'll need to train things in the future inside of earth too and social hubs well social hubs you know it's just like the real world the areas for people to socialize and maybe players will focus on this creating really cool environments that people like meeting up and socializing in so you know they'll have various levels of things that they do inside of the ecosystem and various reasons to have them in certain locations uh he goes on to say also I’m excited to see the different style variations of these building types like modern sci-fi mythical Asian cyberpunk brutalists plus many more and yeah we're excited to show them as well they're they are a work in progress we haven't released any other styles yet we're focusing on one style and we will continue to focus on the one style right now uh in in the in the near future but we're as excited as you are to see them we're as excited as uh to release them so you will be seeing different styles so the styles that you see in the vlogs at the moment that's one style those buildings will have multiple other styles that players will be able to select when building so the ones that you see now they're only one style of building one particular style there'll be a lot of other styles released for every single building all right we've got a comment here from Mr wolf and Mr wolf says I think places like Manhattan or big cities won't be areas for ecosystem structures I imagine that places like a museum for nfts concerts game arenas and ar stuff something tied to real places activities in that location I think it means that that would be pretty cool I think for example Coca-Cola would pay big money to install a promoting ar sign in times square or piccadilly circus they could take advantage of the higher foot traffic and the user who would own that tile would earn more in this way yeah that's a that's a very interesting observation and it's something that me personally I’m really curious to see what happens you may be exactly right in that theory it may be that cities in the real world end up being replicated inside of earth 2 and you know these are places where people congregate and it's more valuable to really have your eco sim buildings out somewhere else and transport the requirements in to build these kind of commercial or residential whatever experiences inside a city it might be a better strategy to do that or maybe it's better to you know you've got a big property in the middle of the city maybe you've got some of it working as an ecosim and its powering you've got that right next to where your residential and your commercial are you know the buildings are located so I think it's a I think it's a really interesting observation really plausible in a number of different ways but at the end of the day like that's the type of stuff we'll be very interested to see as well like what happens do people do players like build cities out in the middle of nowhere in a different country and then try to attract online traffic into that city because it's such a an epic place to visit I mean there's a lot of different strategies that I think are going to come into play it's just really interesting theorizing around those so anyway I thought that that was a really cool little statement just wanted to add my two cents so we have a comment here from crush city and crash city says do you think people will have to transport resources to their property if they buy from someone off the market I could see localized resource markets if transportation is too costly not sure it will work that way though so yeah really interesting comment there crust city and thanks for making that comment um again I think this is going to be an interesting thing to see I think there will potentially be localized resource markets maybe localized trade centres for different reasons um and I think this will be something that we will realize over a period of time after the ecosim initially launches and to answer your first question there yes players will very likely have to transport well they will have to transport raw materials or building blocks to their property if they buy it from someone else or maybe pay somebody to deliver it so there will be um a lot of different strategies in many different areas of the ecosim when it goes 3d let me tell you that we've got another little group of comments or conversation here that was picked up and um you know it started off there from uh dairk I’m really sorry I know that I’ve got that wrong I see this player um dairk comment often in in discord and yeah the uh they always have some really interesting things to say but here derrick is saying what do you think would be the community reaction of the number one sold out tomorrow after all it is you know one percent of all the tiles in the game yes there is like the top personal leaderboard does have a I think like almost a million tiles or over a million tiles which is phenomenal but um you know I look at that as part of who we are who earth 2 is it wouldn't be the first way we have had other top players on earth to just not be happy with something and then bang you know I’m not into earth 2 anymore and I’m out of here which is their which is absolutely their um their right to do it's that their own they're free to do as they please and I think we've seen it causes some ripples in the community but I think we've seen that everybody remains pretty vigilant and they at the end of the day it just kind of fades out it's just part of what earth 2 is we have leaderboards people at the top of the leaderboards um you know they get that extra attention at the moment yeah the leaderboards are kind of

Transcript 3.docx","chunkIndex":5,"content":"st part of what earth 2 is we have leaderboards people at the top of the leaderboards um you know they get that extra attention at the moment yeah the leaderboards are kind of focused on how much you know what people have purchased but I do want to move away from that I want to have leaderboards that are focusing on the players that are you know winning the most p verse p's the ones who are doing the best in the eco-sim the ones who are transporting the best the one who you know have the most successful transportation routes or you know they get their goods to where they need to go things like that so there will be many additional leaderboards in in earth 2 and I’m sure players at the top of all of those leaderboards will have some kind of influence or notoriety to them across the community but at the end of the day you know people move on they move on to other things some people like to make a big song and dance about it when they move on some people they just move on I don't know that you would interpret that in any which way it's just it's happened today it's probably going to happen again and it's just I look at it as just part of earth 2. this is this is who we are we people have their own free will to do as they please so yeah it is an interesting comment and as other people have replied under there um yeah well if somebody decides they've had enough there are a lot of people there who just buy their stuff so it is quite it is quite um interesting anyway they're my two cents just thought I’d share that and thanks for the comment got another comment here from Ausie one boy we've had we've had some few quotes from Ausie one such an interesting mind so Ausie one says to me it is sim city meets google earth in an mmo where you own parts of the globe permanently and build your own city and make real money from it then as time moves on the platform morphs into additional experiences see this this guy kind of gets it he's looking at what we're building and piecing things together of course like the phase two stuff that we're building now I mean you could say it's got similarities to SimCity it's got similarities to a lot of different games a lot of type of even like rts games out there you know it's a metaverse it's going to have these game like elements in it so it there are a lot of similarities and there is a lot of interest in that alone like a full like he says google earth but we're talking about earth too our own one-to-one scale size rts kind of trading whatever like trading platform resources generation building all of these kind of things on a global scale that in itself is interesting to anyway to me as a gamer it's quite interesting and that's right like with there's real money involved this is this is something that's a little bit different from other games so people can I know it's an it's a not a word that you we use all the time like play to earn people can play the game and earn on it and the one thing that I think a lot of these other platforms are failing in is that the games are not interesting and not fun and that's something I really want to avoid with earth 2. I want there to be a platform for our phase 2 eco-sim but for it to have so many different strategies that people you know they just they get interested from that alone the different strategies the different things that the different ways that they can do the same thing or avoid conflict or what have you and the end goal there is like being able to build these cool little ecosim setups and use these building blocks to build real experiences like skyscrapers commercial residential you know build droids build transportation empires and all these type of things so is earth 2 going to be that in the future no like as Ausie once said this as time moves on the platform morphs into additional experience that's exactly what we're doing we know that we can't do the phase three stuff right now we can't release that tomorrow and I kind of think that building toward that phase three is just as important as the phase three itself so the foundation that we set through things like phase 2 and this 3d world and all these all these additional parts that we're building these are just as important as the end goal it's going to get us that's going to give us that foundation and for people to really be involved to be putting their time into the project to be actually getting achieving and building things so yeah I thought that was a really interesting observation from Ausie one and um yeah just wanted to have my two cents on it and as time moves on you could you could see what we're building now in many different lights but as time moves on we will gradually morph into this this uh end goal platform that we have for earth 2. so we've got another question here from Jad uh he was actually adding Liz who's one of our community managers and he says I have a question about validation I’ve not seen brought up yet if properties within a mine are not shown showing the resource dot and one of those properties goes through with an is awarded validation would all the other properties in that mine receive validation automatically or would each individual property need to pass the validation individually and great you know this is a great question I actually covered a start of the video I’ll just recap very quickly so what we're planning to do is that if one player validates and that validation is successful will probably cast a net over that general error not every time so we're not guaranteeing that that net or that radius will happen every time we're not guaranteeing that the person who gets validated would be the epicentre of that area however if that does happen than any other existing validations within that radius would be automatically approved or more or less automatically approved so if they don't have then they will get the resource but if they don't have the validation request in live with essence staked behind it they won't get the essence bonus so they'll get the resource if they have a property in that radius they'll they will get the resource confirmed on their property however if there's no validation request in place with essence stake they won't get that essence bonus so I hope that makes sense we have a comment here from virtual tycoon and virtual tycoon says most projects just build behind closed doors and don't release anything for six months or a year earth 2 lets us see the progress mistakes along the way I very much prefer this would you rather earth 2 goes quiet for six months until resources are perfectly fine tuned or would you rather earn essence rewards and watch transparently as they work through the process um virtual tycoon this yeah this was a really interesting comment and it was so interesting and I thought it was so cool and accurate that we actually edited some of this into our next vlog I think it was something around that we just wanted to make this statement because it is very true like a lot of projects they do disappear sometimes for like 12 months before they show anything okay we're gonna we're gonna knuckle down and start building stuff you're not going to see anything um or you're not going to be able to receive anything uh for quite a period of time until we actually build it earth 2 we've done things differently and we've been that way from day one we wanted to include the community in every step along the way we know what we believe will be important in the longevity or the long term relevant moving pieces of earth to like things like essence and jewels um epl's things like this that will be relevant long-term resources so we've what we've tried to do is as you've said like we've tried to involve the earth to community give people access to this even though it's on a 2d web page even though it's not the most beautiful kind of user experience yet uh you know we'll

Transcript 3.docx","chunkIndex":6,"content":"ty or the long term relevant moving pieces of earth to like things like essence and jewels um epl's things like this that will be relevant long-term resources so we've what we've tried to do is as you've said like we've tried to involve the earth to community give people access to this even though it's on a 2d web page even though it's not the most beautiful kind of user experience yet uh you know we'll get to better experiences in the future with our 3d world even though those things are not available we still wanted to uh provide these to the users I wanted to I felt very passionate about doing this instead of just disappearing say hey we're building stuff like go away and just come back later I was like no like there's people who sincerely believe very strongly in this project and hey we're gonna we're gonna roll out this stuff bit by bit and we are we're gonna take the blows of course we're not gonna get it right every time um doing things the way that we're doing them is going to make us a lot more prone to mistakes and yeah of course I’ll put my hand up and say of course there's been mistakes along the way but at the end of the day without those mistakes and without taking that approach there would very likely be a lot of players who would not have got anything they wouldn't have been able to have jewels or crafting or collect essence they wouldn't have been able to do any of these type of things had we just shut down like most other studios and said hey you know we're not we're not going to release anything until we've got what we believe is like a really good final polished product so yeah virtual tycoon I really appreciate that you made this statement and I’m a I appreciate that you realized and noticed this because it does mean a lot to us we're not like your standard project we're not um we're doing things a little bit differently and I thought it was really cool that you identified that and I just wanted to say thank you for realizing it and thanks for the comment all together now I’m not sure whether you guys enjoyed this or whether this video is just like way too long to listen to and if it is just let me know because I you know I have to take my time out this is a this is a Saturday evening here uh around 7 00 p.m. and you know I’ve taken time out to come and record this I don't know if it's too long for people to watch if it is just let me know in the comments below I’ll try and make shorter videos I’ve just been really busy the last few weeks and I haven't had a chance to share uh share thoughts as I usually would so I do like to maybe try and keep the videos to five minutes or so and I’ll try to do that next time um but oh you know if people do like this type of thing let me know I’ll try to do some of this as well maybe answer some questions that are randomly taken from discord uh it certainly gives me more to talk about with things that people are actually asking or curious about or making statements about the next vlog should be going live in a little bit hope you guys enjoy that the problem with the next vlog is I think it's just it's quite visually stimulating so when it's when it's playing like you you're looking at the vlog you're looking and looking but because of all the looking it's like you don't really comprehend all the words and what's being said in the background it kind of gets blurred out because you're looking at all this different stuff so my advice for the next vlog is just I guess um [Music] you know maybe you
