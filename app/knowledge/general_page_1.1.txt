anyway, I need to get to bed guys. Hope some of the answers above were of interest but mainly I just wanted to confirm support will help look after any cases and reach out the Community Manager if there are further issues. Night everyone

Shane
01/07/2024 at 10:03:02 EST
sorry, I won't be sharing any further hints right now. Someone will work it out one day

Shane
01/07/2024 at 10:02:42 EST
For most I think the wait is not very long. We just receive random flags from our banking partners and need to provide further details. It's not easy setting up all of these banking relationships for digital goods, a damn headache for our accounting staff a lot of the time but I believe it's worth it for the long run

Shane
01/07/2024 at 10:00:57 EST
hi there. That is a very creative answer, you have an amazing mind. Unfortunately it's not the answer though. But good luck for next time!

Shane
01/07/2024 at 10:00:18 EST
I need to check the dates, but will review it when I learn about those details. The next 3 months for me are not very pretty .. a lot to do

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:59:39 EST
no further thoughts really. Just watching to see how things progress

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:58:44 EST
please read my message carefully. There is not really a point to repeat it. As I said, we have nothing further to share right now but I can confirm that we're very confident that no sensitive customer data was leaked. If you were genuinely concerned, you would be happy to hear that

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:56:45 EST
Thanks Drew, much appreciated. But oh yeah .. some still claim that e2 is ded 🙂 We make one friendly reminder announcement and sell almost 300K tiles in minutes .. to be honest I didn't see that coming though.

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:54:54 EST
I don't really have any thoughts yet. I read up on it as many others did and am not certain what it means yet - I guess they will release further details when they're ready. If they release something cool then great, the Metaverse doesn't have a great name right now so anything giving it a better name is a good thing, however, we'll have to wait and see. I remember the backlash we received on YouTube for even referencing Ready Play One to give context about what a Metaverse is .. now we have a project claiming they are releasing Ready Player One, this year no less .. so I wonder if they will receive the same attention on YouTube or whether that was just something reserved for Earth 2. Anyway, I will be interested to see what they launch this year, if it ends up being something good then at least it's a +1 for the Metaverse name, will have to wait and see

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:49:49 EST
do we need to explain why something was announced? I believe it was just a friendly reminder. Maybe there will be more.

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:47:21 EST
please refer to the message I shared the other day, we have nothing further to share right now. What I can say, as I did the other day, is that we are very sure that no sensitive customer data was leaked or at risk, so rest assured there is no need to change passwords, or 2FA etc etc. If that were the case, we would have announced something urgently.
09:44:48
is 1am here now and I am about to call it a night, I just heard about this and dropped in to offer an apology on behalf of Earth 2. We certainly didn't expect the sudden rush and selling almost 300K tiles in minutes.

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:43:09 EST
we have capable people overlooking support, I am sure our team will work out a reasonable solution.

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:42:24 EST
exactly as the Community Manager has noted, and I may also add we sincerely apologise to all of those who experienced an overlapping issue. We did not expect this much of a sudden rush with almost 300K tiles selling in minutes. Apologies for this, I know it's frustrating to have to submit a support ticket but as the Community Manager pointed out, Support will look after anyone with an issue.

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:39:34 EST
that's exactly what I was going to point out. You beat me to it. I am sure support will check the time stamp to ascertain who purchased first

Shane
01/07/2024 at 09:38:37 EST
hi hippo. Thanks for the observation. Just pointing out that E2V1 is completely different tech and completely different servers, having said that, I am sure there will be growing pains.

Shane
01/04/2024 at 08:21:54 EST
hi Everyone. Hope you're all doing well. I just want to briefly address that we are aware of rumours regarding part of our website source code allegedly being uploaded by someone online. We are yet to confirm this, but based on what we have seen so far, even if the rumours turn out to be correct, we are very confident that no sensitive customer information has been compromised. This has taken up the majority of the day for a number of our staff, including myself and a number of senior devs involved in reviewing various screenshots shared online, amongst other things, as we take these rumours very seriously and spend time investigating their veracity. We cannot locate the source of where the alleged files were uploaded, so if anyone has any information to share so we can take a closer look, please do reach out to info@earth2.io - we'd really appreciate any further details. We have prepared a statement which is being reviewed. It is almost midnight here now so if the statement needs to be released it won't be until tomorrow morning our local time. The most important thing right now and the reason I am taking time to write this message is that we are very confident that this is not a leak of sensitive customer data and the statement will explain why. Hope you all have a good day or evening ahead.

Shane
12/30/2023 at 12:38:50 EST
anyway, I don't want to miss the sunrise so cannot stop to chat. 3:40am now and I need to drive about 40 mins to get there. Need to pack the car. Bye all

Shane
12/30/2023 at 12:36:37 EST
as mentioned numerous times in this chat, we are spreading awareness. I am happy people are subbing, that's a good result for now. Just because someone sees a video they like doesn't mean they are going to jump on and spend money. They like what they see, then sub'd - great
12:32:11
is 3:30am here and I promised my son I'd take him fishing so just about to leave. Hope you all have a good day and enjoy seeing in the new year

Shane
12/30/2023 at 12:31:41 EST
thank you and to you

Shane
12/30/2023 at 12:31:27 EST
right, but I find it odd that some would want to pursue it so actively after we have clearly confirmed what we are doing and why the results are there. I am not even sure why we needed to explain all the details, I am not sure other projects explain in detail when, why and how they are running awareness campaigns. Anyway, it is was it is - maybe I will slow the awareness campaign down a bit into the new year so people can feel more at ease and stop being disappointed that the subs + views are going up

Shane
12/30/2023 at 12:28:13 EST
we are spreading awareness. It's been stated numerous times. We have had some really good success via YT as well. I mentioned a number of times we are testing various social channels. Perhaps just enjoy it? The fact people see the clips and decide to sub is great, it means next time when we want to promote say game play, or other progress, there will be a larger audience who has already heard about E2. I don't understand what people expect to gain from continuously bringing up a subject of 'things not adding up' or 'it's all fake'. We've explained that it's not, we explained why it's not and what we are doing, yet people still try to push this. I am curious what they expect to gain from it. They want E2 to be successful but happily push type of thing time and time again - what benefit does it brng them? As I mentioned, just enjoy the fact that people like to clip enough to sub, that's where my head is at and it's good to see some results from a fairly small awareness campaign. I am really suprised at the subs as I mentioned before, it's a good thing not a bad thing

Shane
12/30/2023 at 12:22:40 EST
this is exactly right, we / I myself have made so many statements reaffirming it that it's diffcult to believe people still have an issue with it

Shane
12/25/2023 at 11:19:54 EST
thank you - and Merry Christmas to you too. Hope you all enjoy the rest of it wherever you are in the world. Keep safe!
11:19:12
Merry Christmas everyone. Hope you all had a safe and memorable day with family and loved ones 🎄

Shane
12/23/2023 at 06:47:50 EST
now please, let me go buy some skins lol

Shane
12/23/2023 at 06:46:48 EST
100% agree. Just lodge a ticket to support for a refund and they will check it out for you. So just to be clear, if you didn't notice the price on checkout and purchased in the first few minutes before the listed page price was updated, then just create a ticket and support will deal with it for you. This was a UI issue because of an admin setting, it was fixed within a few minutes when we realised but we take responsibility and if you purchased a skin in the first few minutes when the display issue was there then you will get a refund and your skins will go back into the supply pool - no problem. It's a pity this happened as our team spent quite some time designing and modelling these items to be game ready, but we did fix it within a couple of minutes. Anyway, for those who like the skins then please enjoy.
06:41:29
06:41:03
sorry there was a mistake with the admin settings, however, on checkout it did show actual price before buying. Having said that, if anyone who purchased before in the first few minutes before the issue was resolved wants a refund then just email support. They will check the time of purchase and process the refund for you. Any that are refunded will go back into the supply pool for others to purchase at a later date. Just be mindful our support is limited over the break so may not be refunded until they fully return.

Shane
12/21/2023 at 12:19:24 EST
I have given up on Christmas this year, I told my family we might have to celebrate it late just too much work to be done

Shane
12/21/2023 at 12:18:28 EST
the CM is just following guidelines. Blame the guidelines (which we agreed to internally as a team), not the CM

Shane
12/21/2023 at 12:17:30 EST
I just checked up on the conversation above and can see multiple comments targeted at the CM for doing their job. Like this comment and many others. I am surprised she didn't give you a time out behaving like that. You should probably appreciate the fact she didn't yet you're in here continuing on with it. What message does that send to the CM? To me it sends a message that letting the situation settle down does not work, some people just continue on
12:12:23
seriously, the time some people have for this much drama

Shane
12/21/2023 at 12:11:59 EST
not without reason

Shanewe are doing this too, but when I see a team member struggling or being treated unfairly I feel obliged to jump in. Maybe it's a trait I need to reconsider, but it's just part of who I am .. if I see people in trouble I will usually try to help them.

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:45:16 EST
I feel silly recounting that story now and I shouldn't have referenced it or brought it up so I edited it out.

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:39:23 EST
anyway, I am off sorry. Has been a long day.

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:37:59 EST

12:33:42
Have been so busy I just realised I lost my Supercharged E-ther Boost 🤦 Great ..

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:21:15 EST
this is exactly right. The CM gets little time from me but I am in the group channel on slack where the CM reports + shares messages she plans to post etc. I saw the message she planned to post and I thought it looked like a reasonable message, then I hear about people getting upset because of a few words. I wanted to see for myself .. and saw the same people trying to undermine the CM. It's tiresome
12:18:23
also before people start, we have paid all the rights for the song we used to BGM and the various publishers (4 of them in total!). We need to get the copyright removed so ads stop running but it's not super high on the agenda
12:16:39
anyway, just respect the requests from the CM or mods please. This is all a waste of valuable time and energy which could be easily avoided. For example, I received a report on someone in here earlier today saying the dislike ratio on our new video was 1.9K dislikes or something. We cannot be expected to provide evidence on every little accusation like this, but if we don't then people believe it .. so what can we do apart from ask people to please cease pushing misinformation. It's too time consuming to be fetching data to prove every little lie coming from these people as wrong. I mean here is our like / dislike ratio. Directly from YouTube - yet we have people in here claiming the complete opposite. It's tiresome
LikesRatio.png
44.2KB

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:11:01 EST
we will be saving the gameplay footage for some bigger events next year. I provided more details around this the other day I believe. So yes, it's not abandoned by any means

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:03:21 EST
that would be great if mods could please keep across this

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:02:11 EST
we 'shouldn't' need to respond, but unfortunately based on the reports I receive if we don't respond they just keep on with it and before we know it a few people in our own discord are pushing these absurd notions left right and centre

Shane
12/19/2023 at 12:00:29 EST
another ridiculous comment. Do you know what marketing campaign we are running? What our focus is? What we are testing? We have a plan, just let us get on with it. Just because you don't see new people in here asking you to hold their hand doesn't mean we are not achieving our goals. Please
11:59:06
just be happy people actually like WATCHING the video and decided to SUB!
11:58:05
it's getting tiresome to be honest, these reports I receive are just ridiculous sometimes and people refuse to respect warnings or polite requests. Look at this latest thing with the video. - other projects / youtubers buy fake views, subs (etc) fake comments etc etc, nobody bats an eyelid, yeah it's just normal who cares - Earth 2 runs a legitimate awareness campaign, 100% legal and absolutely normal and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE! FAKE! WEIRD! SOMETHING IS WRONG! NOTHING IS ADDING UP! LOOK! A COMMENT FROM A BOY WHO ONLY HAS A FEW VIDEOS ON HIS ACCOUNT! LOOK! SOME NEGATIVE LIKES ON A FACEBOOK POST! SUPER WEIRD SOMETHING IS GOING ON! And even if we spend the time to nicely explain what we are doing, it continues. It gets tiresome guys, really tiresome and is a complete waste of time on something that should not even be an issue

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:52:36 EST
EXACTLY!

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:49:49 EST
EXACTLY

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:46:17 EST
exactly

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:45:15 EST
and I have not provided information explaining the results? If you don't want to believe it, fine, no problem. But the CM has asked people to stop pushing these weird notions of everything being fake so at least respect that and keep it to yourself

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:42:58 EST
it was all fake, there were some negative likes

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:42:35 EST
not wondering, suggesting why

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:42:06 EST
I don't even know what you are referring to with regards to these negative likes, but yes, by all means, let's focus on some negative likes and ignore the fact the channel has over 100K followers and 300K + views on the video. It was not worth it because there were a few negative likes
11:40:00
is anyone here?

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:39:57 EST
are you working as part of our marketing team?

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:38:04 EST
my goodness ..
11:37:34
just a COMPLETE waste of TIME and ENERGY

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:37:23 EST
I agree with this.

Shane
12/19/2023 at 11:36:21 EST
more like trying to associate everything as being fake because of a few fb likes

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:32:07 EST
just message CM with details. There are too many different reasons it could be. If you've withdrawn multiple times our banking partners can even flag and ask us to review
17:30:46
anyway, I am out. I have a big day today. Keep safe and please, consider letting us just test these awareness campaigns and enjoy the fact some are deciding to watch the video and sub. I am really pleasantly surprised on the sub count increase, did not expect that at all.

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:28:06 EST
I can only imagine.. I have heard we still receive daily comments on YouTube accusing us of being a scam due to the accusatory driven videos published about us in the past. It all gets recorded and documented.

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:25:31 EST
ok will check it out, thanks

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:25:05 EST
sorry, it wouldn't be right to comment on that. They are head of a stock exchange listed company and I will treat those discussions privately for now

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:22:48 EST
no comment 

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:22:05 EST
thanks Zenderman - really appreciate the comment 🙏

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:21:07 EST
thanks Drew, much appreciated.

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:20:13 EST
no it's work related, not holidays. I doubt I will get a chance for a break this year .. hoping for maybe 1 week early Jan but nothing planned and even that is not looking possible. I want to use the downtime over the holiday break to try and catch up on things I can't get to due to my other daily distractions I get

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:18:07 EST
oh I see, you mean the current video. Yes possibly if we keep the campaigns running but I am not sure whether I will or if so for how long

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:17:19 EST
it's not a super hype video, I said it's laid back and enjoyable I feel

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:16:32 EST
no. I am flying today and will be part of my schedule but does not mean anything yet and as I said, there are many things to consider here and I want to get the adjustments right which will be beneficial for every Essence holder. Please see my previous messages on this topic.

Shane
12/17/2023 at 17:12:43 EST
so let me get this right. You're now saying everything is fake because a boy who only has a few videos on his YouTube profile commented. These are some pretty harsh rules being applied to Earth 2 here .. why are people so focused on trying to find anything to make it fake? I am genuinely curious. You do realise that most people with a YouTube account never upload a single video and rarely have any visual information about themselves. It's very common on YouTube yet you're here saying everything is unfortunately fake because a boy with only a few videos commented. These are some very harsh double standard rules being applied to e2 here .. just let us get on with our job please. I could probably find thousands of comments under any big youtube channel and locate comments from people who have no info on their profile.

Shane
12/17/2023 at 15:40:09 EST
I have answered the question you asked probably more than 10 times over the past 2 months on Discord and Twitter. Absurd you say I'm avoiding it because I don't answer you

Shane
12/17/2023 at 15:39:25 EST
well it's a result of a campaign we are testing. But much higher interest than we had on the video from last year so that's a good sign

Shane
12/17/2023 at 15:38:25 EST
I am only posting the message above, if I write anything further that message is forgotten. Focus on the message above and let it sink in please.
15:37:21
hey guys. I can't be in here 24/7 repeating the same statement over and over. I have already commented numerous times that we are running some awareness campaigns on various socials. If you must know, we tested the exact same thing with video from Dec 2022 and nobody said a word. Why? Probably because the interest and engagement was not this high. This new footage IS getting better results which IS a good thing. Let's just leave it now please, it looks terrible having e2 community members in here carrying on about it being fake, someone else buying fake views, subs (I am also very surprised about the subs .. we have not pushed any campaigns to focus on increasing subs, just awareness) after we have confirmed on numerous occasions that we are pushing an awareness campaign and the results are in line with that campaign. Also I heard YouTube don't tend to run ads on 'fake' views, it would destroy their whole business model for advertisers and copyright owners alike. I just saw an ad for Kung Fu Panda 4 on the latest e2 video. Doubt they would be pushing those premium ads on fake views. That aside, I will just copy paste what I wrote above again because surely someone will ignore it and carry on with the fake view narrative. > I can't be in here 24/7 repeating the same statement over and over.

12/17/2023 at 06:17:49 EST
anyway, I am off. Enjoy the rest of your weekend

Shane
12/17/2023 at 06:17:25 EST
it may not be in the WP, details will be revealed closer to launch. This is one area I am receiving significant legal advice around

Shane
12/17/2023 at 06:16:39 EST
I am not confirming one way or the other I'm sorry

Shane
12/17/2023 at 06:15:51 EST
we have a lot planned but I am not going to say what or give dates I'm sorry. Let's just let things happen. But we have a lot planned for Q1 and Q2 moving into a new era for E2

Shane
12/17/2023 at 06:14:44 EST
bull markets don't last a few weeks. You're seeing a bit of movement but let's just say it was the start of the bull market, for a second let's say this was the case, it should continue on for some time. Anyway, I am trying to make adjustments to benefit the Players significantly so please don't say after 2 years I need to delay solely due to legal advice
06:11:29
I am not able to stay and chat, I just popped in and saw that message so wanted to clear up that incorrect summary on what I wrote earlier today

Shane
12/17/2023 at 06:09:48 EST
it's not only due to legal advice. Please re-read my messages carefully instead of picking out one part. I was very clear that the changes I want to make will be extremely beneficial for every Essence token holder. You and others will see what I mean when the details are revealed. I suggest not to get upset about it until you see what the changes are, you'll be doing so at your own unnecessary detriment.

ShaneI really need to get back to work, but I will try to answer a few more questions. Nothing past here though

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:37:45 EST
ok I caught up finally! All this time was just in order to catch up to where I left this message ! I hope the answers provided some insight for some of you and hope you all have a good weekend ahead

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:36:54 EST
and they already make too much money to even care. Why would you change a business model that already makes you billions a year?

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:36:30 EST
those type of opportunities will come once the token has launched

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:35:49 EST
yeah we did. He has been great so far! From the States

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:35:18 EST
thank you!

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:35:09 EST
could / if .. such big words. I agree with a cautious approach but living by those words would ensure nobody tries anything new

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:34:07 EST
those arguments will not have a leg to stand on next year... they will of course start complaining about something else. The MOON IS NOT A CIRCLE! SCAMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:33:01 EST
our goal is big, if I wanted to do that it would have been a long time ago and I don't think it would have benefited us to be honest. Some projects create a small access area to play around in, but we're recreating the planet Earth .. kind of goes against our main goal. So we're aiming big, I want the first release to be the entire planet

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:31:23 EST
good idea and I think that would be pretty simple. @Earth 2 Team can you make a note and ensure it's recorded for review. So long as it's simple (i.e 1 day dev time) we could probably do that

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:29:41 EST
as much as I'd love to, I definitely cannot share dates on this. We are pushing hard though. Some potentially big surprises coming first half of next year but we'll see how it goes

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:28:44 EST
well, we're doing the best we can with the support we have and we've shown we're committed and making good progress for a small team. Given the history of these well established global corporations, I doubt anyone user on their platforms would get anywhere near the opportunity they would on ours. They don't need it .. they can dictate the terms and they do. I think there will always be an attraction to a Metaverse that shares in the success, but it takes money to build these things and this tech, it doesn't just happen. So every time you buy tiles, or a skin, or something from the Bazaar, or trade, it's helping us build and expand and we try the best we can to return that favour by trying to incorporate products that help our Players to earn something as we build the foundations for this world

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:23:46 EST
no I mean E$ - this opportunity (IF IT HAPPENS) will be provided just before the Essence token officially launches

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:23:03 EST
it's a great idea and certainly something we have flagged, but it's a low priority right now with focus going into other higher priority areas leading up to bigger releases

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:22:02 EST
we have a script waiting to air drop locked countries ready to execute when the time is right + the historic claims will also be finalised. I can not give you an exact date I'm sorry but I can say there will be a form of refund on the Essence staked etc and I think it will be more than fair
17:19:15
I have to find where I was up to now with the questions from before I said "no more questions from here"

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:18:20 EST
of course we plan to expand. I believe I've commented on this many times in the past

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:17:56 EST
please read my messages above carefully. I have provided a clear reason why. It WILL work out a lot more beneficial for every Essence holder for us to get this right. Or I could just release now with 5B supply and miss all the addition adjustments I want to make which will benefit every Essence holder ..

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:16:26 EST
I said I am not committing to a date
17:16:08
this is another sad thing I see from people who benefitted a lot from e2 .. they even write things like "I made 10x on Earth 2, it's a scam". I mean you have to question the mentality of some of these people who benefited so much from a project, then go out of their way spending time to try and badmouth it publicly.. must have some really messed up lives

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:14:19 EST
it's a big IF on the thing I have in mind anyway, I need to make sure my plans are ok first. But if what I am thinking does move ahead you may qualify in another area .. but having said that, of course we want to provide some opportunities for our biggest supporters and believers in the project, those who sold out or profited so far have for the most part already been pretty well rewarded

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:12:16 EST
sorry I really don't get time to read messages. It is busy enough internally for me every day with work and the team.. I rarely work less than a 16 hour day and if I spent time checking my messages I'd never get anything done.

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:09:49 EST
I think that's always been part of the decision people make. I guess the details in the WP will begin to give you some indication on whether you were right or wrong
17:08:06
I really need to get back to work, but I will try to answer a few more questions. Nothing past here though

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:07:30 EST
yes we did - we have a lot more which we haven't shown yet. But again, as I mentioned above, there are better times to show things which benefit the project and the community much more

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:06:50 EST
I have a very specific system in mind. I think I have mentioned in the past that I want Players to populate the world with life, so the initial Chapter 1 will be the beggining of that where Players can find and collect life forms which can later be sythensised (in a later chapter). Chapter 1 will already have a lot to it, especially for a relatively small team, so I have a vision of steps in which these things will roll out. Regarding the pet thing .. I am not saying anything just yet. Maybe you're lucky enough to find a very rare T-Rex, you keep it (as opposed to maybe cooking it?), and in the future when you synthesise it you have no idea what might happen .. perhaps it will eat you or will love you. I guess Players will have to find out

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:03:40 EST
that is the game play trailer / teaser. Again, you might get a tease but as I mentioned the other day, I would much rather save that footage for a bigger event. We have certainly shown the progress on E2V1 and shown some of what we've been working on, and I think most were pretty pleased / surprised for the most part on how far we've come with a small team in just year. But think about it, should we drop intriguing game play footage just for the sake of it or should we leave it for a bigger even next year to gain better awareness. These are things I need to consider.

Shane
12/16/2023 at 17:00:50 EST
I am very picky about these things .. I want minimalistic, informative and beautiful .. you don't want to be designing for me ..

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:59:22 EST
I am not committing to anything as I mentioned above, we are working on a number of things, the team is working extremely hard and I don't want to push them too much. We're constantly pushing hard for the next thing, we also need some time to recharge, it's been a big year

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:58:07 EST
no, it's just a chill audio. But it fits the scenery

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:57:30 EST
well that is one thing I am looking at, providing some opportunities for Players with the most tiles, most Essence, best Raiders, Diamond hands (no withdrawals) and a few others .. it may be a progressive thing, so if one group don't take up on the opportunity it moves to the next group OR maybe all get the same opportunity at the same time. But that's what I am saying, there are a few adjustments I'm working on (not only this one but other adjustments that will benefit every Essence holder) so just want work through them and get them right

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:54:42 EST
yes there will be at least one more video this month, I mentioned the other day there is a longer more chill video .. I love watching it. Does not really say a lot, but more reminders on how vast and beautiful E2V1 is

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:53:31 EST
please see that answer above. I kind of mixed it all into one response as I was typing

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:52:08 EST
I am not sure off the top of my head. Also I have some work to get back to which I really need to focus on. Lawyers offices are shutting down this week and I want to get some final advice on a few things before that happens so I can reassess our position on the WP release. I am still not saying it will be released this month but what I can say is the adjustments being made a very favourable to anyone holding Essence so I want be sure we get it right, it's as sound as it can be from a legal perspective etc. So just give us some space because the adjustments being made will work out much better for any Essence holders in the long run.

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:48:01 EST
you may not see any for a while, even after the token is launched. But I imagine there will be a constant rush to get as much as possible once the details are released so enjoy the lower competition for now

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:45:34 EST
quick! Grab it!
16:43:00
ok we seem to have fixed the issue with the server for now. The site should be working optimally. One note though is that we have termporarily removed the Mentar icon for the property being actively Raided. This is only a temporary thing but just want people to be aware. We will look at reactivating the Mentar icon as soon as we can, but given tomorrow is a Sunday for most of our dev team it may or may not happen tomorrow or Monday. So just be aware, properties you're actively raiding will not have the little Mentar icon next to them for now.

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:04:24 EST
I am going to jump back to team chat now on the website issue. We may have a short term fix, have identified one very specific area in raiding where an optimised query was overlooked but I will provide more details once we've deployed and tested the theory

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:03:20 EST
definitely surprises, I did not expect the order of releases at all

Shane
12/16/2023 at 16:02:46 EST
it was designed to work the way it works .. if we keep watering things down then what? We give everyone a chance to vote their own Territory and win their own prize? Of course I thought there would be other openings much earlier, but there weren't - completely unexpected but that's what the biggest group of votes have determined. It just seems some are working together better than others and if you look at the total number of votes winning the releases they only make up a fraction of the circulating suppy of Essence .. so it's asking to change a set of rules because one group is collaborating too well and I don't think that's a good reason to change things

Shane
12/16/2023 at 15:59:32 EST
all good thanks. I just dropped in to update on the server / website issue. Am going to go back and keep working on it with the team
15:57:30
enough of that thanks. Many Koreans would find that comment offensive @Crazy Dev . Groups are playing within the rules for voting on T3 Territories, if you want to change that then work better as a group like other groups are, don't ask for the rules to be changed to make it easier for you. (Oh I can see the message was already deleted .. no more comments like that, is not acceptable) I just dropped in to say we are aware of the current issue on the server and are working on a solution to hopefully resolve the problem for now.

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:32:30 EST
what in the world is this .. lol

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:31:56 EST
then please stand up
01:31:38
anyway, I need to get going. Hope you all have a good day ahead and enjoy the weekend
01:30:50
we have quite a few things moving behind the scenes for next year, there are some key points releasing game play footage would be a much wiser move for publicity and celebrating certain events. If that is the case, I still have another 7 min video I can drop, nice relaxing one that just casually celebrates how awesome E2V1 actually is .. less rushed

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:28:59 EST
perhaps ..

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:28:45 EST
it is mainly aim at keeping our own Players updated .. remember we have quite a lot

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:27:29 EST
we are contemplating a few things right now regarding the second video. Maybe more footage of E2V1 and save the game play leading up to a bigger stage to get a lot more attention / publicity from it .. we might show a short teaser. There are many things going on behind the scenes right now, I don't have a clear answer I'm sorry.
01:24:32
anyway, I have to get going, just wanted to clarify the above. And again, cannot trust that 3rd party software, very odd results there

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:23:55 EST
we're just testing a few things. Seeing what type of reach we can get, setting audiences etc. We will test other platforms too

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:23:07 EST
I guess not everyone is logged into their youtube account. I watch many videos without logging in and almost never leave a comment. You see some videos with 10 million views and 3K comments or less .. not out of place
01:21:51
the above screenshot is directly from YouTube
01:21:10
so the 3rd party software is completely messed up if you're saying you just watched it go from 30K to 80K in a couple of hours
01:20:44
there is about 20K views in the past 24 hours
01:20:35
so today is on the right side
01:20:12
@Drew that is the last 48 hours. It looks like it just spiked when some awareness campaigns were running. As Mr Green said, if they are bots or fake views or whatever, youtube would notify us and remove them. Anyway, I have provided an explanation when I don't really have to but it's odd seeing these arguments in here against one another because the video is getting more views
last48hours.png
7.93KB

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:16:27 EST
then YouTube is wrong and the third party software is right
01:15:52
I can see in YouTube it was around 20K for the entire day during an awareness campaign. The fact people click through and watch some is good

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:15:11 EST
it wasn't 50K views in a few hours .. no idea where this even came from ?

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:14:51 EST
I already checked

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:14:44 EST
it's from facebook. I can't really say much more than that

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:13:36 EST
I saw it, when a big company like FB run ads they hit hundreds of thousands in a short period of time. Also 3rd party programs are not the most reliable
01:12:49
and from what I see it was around 19K views today. Nothing too spectacular

Shane
12/15/2023 at 01:12:04 EST
yes it seems this is the reason. We're just running an awareness campaign on FB. Hope this will put all the arguments to rest

Shane
12/10/2023 at 12:30:42 EST
heads up that we've just fixed the issue some were having when slotting their jewels. Should be live and fully deployed to prod now. Really appreciate our devs + QA + devops jumping on this on a Sunday to get the issue resolved.

Shane
12/10/2023 at 06:15:30 EST
good thanks. I can't stick around to chat sorry, I am busy on a few things but just wanted to provide the above thoughts as I know a few others (no Seike) have been in here trying to draw focus on this new game. Hope you all enjoy your weekend
06:13:18
Another positive I take from all of this is that people are super interested in massive open worlds to explore and play in, so once we release E2V1 and continue building on it over coming years I am confident people will be interested in jumping in, I mean look at the response on this video with a little game play teasers and it's not even our real Earth! As I said, the only thing that really got me was the specific focus on "Earth" in the trailer, it's a very powerful claim and from my experience you'd better be willing to back it up, or maybe the YouTubers will go easy on them because they're not "Earth 2". (Screenshot above - this is what I mean about vast long view distances, it has a profound effect on how 'everything' feels when you can see as far as the horizon.. much like the beautiful world we live in)

Shane
12/10/2023 at 06:13:06 EST
yes I saw this trailer too and first I would point out that any game development with massive worlds is very cool, in fact I just find any game development cool if they are focused on delivering an interesting product that people enjoy using, after all, that's the bottom line, creating something that people enjoy spending time on. I realise Earth 2 does not have that mass appeal yet, but we have tried to build in a way that provides something to do for those who want to be hands on in the lead up to E2V1 and beyond and there are people who enjoy that aspect. For those in here trying to draw a comparison here to Earth 2 (which is obviously why I am even responding here), you have to remember this game has been built on an engine they have been working on for over 13 years and on top of that has had a dedicated team working specifically on Light No Fire (without external pressure) for 5 years. If anything, this shows how complicated the tech is and how impressive E2V1 is over such a short period of time. Even taking some of these things into consideration after watching the trailer I had a couple of thoughts: 1 - I was curious why they kept saying Earth as opposed to Earth-size as the main point of focus at the beginning of the video. Those words used there sets precedence for the remaining pay of the video and makes it more exciting, but the thing is, the game world they are making is not at all even on Earth. Creating a procedural world the size of Earth vs creating the actual Earth are two very different things, one is a lot easier than the other. When any reasonable person sees Earth they would think of the beautiful planet we live on, I mean you look at the definition of Earth and it's "the planet on which we live on". So it's curious how they specifically referred to it being Earth in the video; A MULTIPLAYER EARTH A PROCEDURAL EARTH A FANTASY EARTH AN UNEXPLORED EARTH With 'EARTH' remaining visible at all times as the core focus point when even themselves they admit in the small print that it's just Earth-sized. We claimed to be creating a digital Earth and we had to based it on Earth and I think if we advertised our world is Earth and it turned out not to be Earth, there would no doubt be a group of YouTubers calling us out on that.. I wonder if the same level of critique will be applied here because obviously it's a massive selling point and is the first major point the video focuses on with EARTH being visible for the first 13 seconds. 2 - Another thing I felt is why the footage feels a bit restricted somehow, like not open, clear and vast, especially when I compare my experience inside E2V1 or even what anyone can see from the footage we have released last year and this year. 3 - When the dragon flies up over the mountain ridge (very cool!) I noticed they moved the camera angle down very quickly, so I wondered why they did this and went back to pause. I noticed the distant view looks empty / no formation or terrain, and that might be the reason they put white clouds there to obscure the view. Another reason might also be to hide the view distance of the massive boulders which were popping in at relatively close distance. Anyway, I'm not going to dive into comparisons with E2V1, there are many, but what I'd prefer to focus on is that at the end of the day it's a very cool video and though I'm not sure how far away we are from having dragon mounts, it's good to see someone like Sean Murray come back from being heavily criticised on No Man's Sky in the past, a heavily ambitious project, receiving death threats (I know what that's like) and turn things around to keep building, a really good result for him and their studio at the end of the day which is awesome to see!

anyway, I need to do something presently so have to head off. Enjoy the day

Shane
12/03/2023 at 06:11:42 EST
pretty sure we have them, there were many we have not not showcased in that footage

Shane
12/03/2023 at 06:11:15 EST
would be very well drafted 2D drawings. The more angles / detail the better. We may also accept 3D models too

Shane
12/03/2023 at 06:10:48 EST
I didn't say you can't see flags, you can see flags in E2V1 and you can see the flags at MUCH greater view distances that on the website. So we're definitely not getting rid of tile art. You've seen the screenshots I shared in the past I'm sure

Shane
12/03/2023 at 06:09:38 EST
yeah I am very excited about that aspect ! It rewards artists and creative people, from the community, which is something I believe strongly in. Want a good pirate character or knight ? Come up with a kick ass design, get some votes and our team will review it! Just a note though, does not mean we can / will accept every winning vote, there may be reasons we cannot create some

Shane
12/03/2023 at 06:07:53 EST
will do thank you

Shane
12/03/2023 at 06:07:39 EST
heatmaps are not high priority, I have explained previously that they will not be part of E2V1 so they have been a low priority to maintain on the website. Bottom line is probably not to expect it fixed, we're looking toward E2V1

Shane
12/03/2023 at 06:05:43 EST
this is incorrect. I have explained above and in the announcement text that is was due to the article being released later than expected due to things getting busy last night. It was extended for a few hours, and will never happen again on future drops unless there is a technical difficulty or something

Shane
12/03/2023 at 01:31:09 EST
ok I need to get going now, such a crazy day and still going full speed ahead .. hope you all enjoy your Sunday
01:30:16
hey guys - just a couple quick points. I've not caught up on chat still working on things and too much to read (I might try and stream reading through and responding to comments if anyone interested in that? Might be easier than replying and I can probably share more). Anyway, few quick points - yes there are 30K, 5K of those earnable in game. I am not looking at now I'm looking into the future. Sure 30K sounds like a lot now, but even with a few hundred thousand players (which we already have registered) it starts looking more scarce, and then throw in potential millions of Players over the years and starts looking very rare even at 30K .. you know some of these larger games put no limit on their skins (cannot be sold p2p anyway) and there are still Players wanting them, trying to work out when they will even be available to purchase again (and we're not even talking about gacha here ..). - so sure, 30K but they will never be discounted again and that number might not seem so high in the future - also as I tweeted on X just a couple of hours ago (don't hold me to it!!!) but I want Players to be able to group a few of their avatars and explore together, so you know .. camp sites, explore, rest etc. Sure you might need to come up with more food water, but I want it to be a group system and if we can (LONG TERM) introduce AI (preferably player influenced!) then that would be cool too. So potentially you could have Kyung as part of your group when exploring. Now it's too early to confirm all of this but just letting you know what I am thinking and envisioning. - lastly, just quickly, we were supposed to release the Earth 2 Skin store article much earlier to give Players a better understanding on how the system works before the timer started, but there were a few last minute things and we didn't get to it. Therefore I extended the time. Actually it's worse for Earth 2 for the timer to be extended as it means more discounted sales as opposed to full price sales as only full price will ever be available when she goes on sale in the future

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:27:05 EST
let's just enjoy this one for now lol. Ok I am really off! I think I can finally sleep in peace for one night now this is released! I just need to settle down too much excitement .. argh. Bye all!

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:26:10 EST
Fish. Fish. Fish

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:24:12 EST
we want to sell more than 3

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:19:55 EST
just clarifying, I wasn't pointing a finger at you with regards to my comment by any means
08:18:48
I'm out - night everyone

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:18:41 EST
yes, I didn't say we're not and I certainly didn't say I don't have a plan. I would prefer to grow slow and organically with the RIGHT TOKEN HOLDERS than to go haywire and pump and dump our precious Essence

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:17:52 EST
wait and see

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:17:44 EST
yeah we will have that type of opportunity. Of course we want people uploading beautiful footage
08:17:13
anyway, I am pretty exhausted guys, so many question and I wish I could answer them all. I think maybe a Q and A soon when things settle a bit will be easier, then I can just answer without typing it all out. You imagine being in a chat room with 30 people asking questions then trying to answer them all lol .. I mean I love it but I feel bad that I can't answer all the questions and sit here typing like a mad man !

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:16:01 EST
and where did I say we're going to be putting jaw dropping amounts of ETH in exactly? I know we were successful but we're not Microsoft or Google guys. We've made tens of millions in revenue which is great, but we also have to pay taxes, employees and we're trying to build the beginnings of something that facebook, for example, is throwing billions at. Not sure where these expectations are coming from, we're doing the best we can but we need to build and expand the team to succeed. Also, the climate is shifting in Web3 / blockchain as far as legislation, compliance etc. There are rules I need to follow too. I have top law firms that advise me on what I can, can't or should / shouldn't do. I realise you'd love e2 to through buckets of ETH into a liquidity pool so you could cash out, along with thousands of others .. but where does that leave e2 and building what we've set out to build?

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:10:20 EST
when did I say that?

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:09:38 EST
you'll learn about this, but we will be aiming for stamina, health, hunger, thirst, body temp (maybe later) while exploring E2V1. If you die there will be consequences too .. so don't die

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:08:37 EST
we will be aiming for release next year, as early as we can. Have quite a bit to get through though

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:08:09 EST
yes I want to allow that, we have already tested so should be good. I just need to figure out what happens close to coast lines .. I have mentioned this before when answering others

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:07:23 EST
That's cool!!!

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:07:00 EST
Kyung may return at points in the future, not sure. But she will never be discounted again. That's just a celebration for today

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:06:28 EST
people buy landmarks for different reasons. I still plan to have an AR aspect to E2 in the future, we're building in Unity, right? There are just higher priorities first. Also, what do you think the first thing Players are going to do inside E2V1? Maybe check what's happening in popular locations? Maybe others will make their own popular locations. There is a lot to consider

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:04:59 EST
haha no

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:04:37 EST
maybe others will want to be interoperable with us? But to answer your question, we're taking things one step at a time. I can see your passionate about decentralised ownership and that's fine, maybe we will have what you're looking for one day in the future

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:03:18 EST
thank you. Not right now, we need to get the basics out first. These other voxel based concepts are cool, but they are small and limited (in my opinion). Sure you can build whatever you want but I wanted something that looks a bit more realistic. That means we need to make exceptions - I don't think it's an issue though. Also, need to remember we building on a world scale, not a small AAA environment that has more freedom. You see every shot in that video of E2V1? YOU CAN TRAVEL THERE. You can go to that mountain top you see in the distant horizon. It's just different goals my friend

Shane
12/02/2023 at 08:00:42 EST
we're building a metaverse. There should not be limitation .. dinosaurs, horses, fish, unicorns, dragons .. you know, it's a metaverse. I appreciate games have certain art styles and intentional restrictions in their game design, but we have a bit of freedom and I intend to use it

Shane
12/02/2023 at 07:58:52 EST
correct, I take it as compliment that you thought it was pre-rendered. It shows a lot of people are going to be shocked when we release

Shane
12/02/2023 at 07:57:44 EST
welcome friend. We can be enternally tired together

Shane
12/02/2023 at 07:57:23 EST
team is very happy, many had not seen the footage as we keep it pretty confidential until release. Quite a few even in the team were shocked which is great

Shane
12/02/2023 at 07:56:28 EST
I'm not sure, I just want to sleep tbh but have to wait for the adrenaline to settle down.

Shane
12/02/2023 at 07:54:39 EST
we will show this. If you're interested in seeing it just follow along. Thanks for your questions, but I can assure you all footage is in-game real time. I drop into E2V1 often running around, we'll be showing more as things progress

Shane
12/02/2023 at 07:14:25 EST
hope you guys enjoyed - a lot of effort from a small team to make that progress. Huge biome system, water across the entire planet, test of 2nd Gen Civs, new Character system .. and too many other things I cannot even think of right now

Shane
12/02/2023 at 06:58:38 EST
enjoy the vid guys! I am here too!

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:57:18 EST
anyway, I am out guys, 6am and has been a very long night. I have some more things to wrap up so I want to focus on those before taking a nap. Keep safe and hope you all enjoy the video! I will be watching somewhere!

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:56:29 EST
surely I am aiming for before, that has always been the plan

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:54:32 EST
I just want to get through the next couple of weeks first, but yes I'd like to get it out this month (don't hold me to it)

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:53:35 EST
I am not aware of this. I know one of our accounting staff has been away but I don't think there are big delays, but there are so many things that could trigger delays you cannot pin it onto one reason. For example, some Players might withdraw over time then when they hit a large amount we receive requests from our banking partners to check on AML, fraud, proof of wealth etc. It's fairly standard.

I took a look at some of the other instances this song was used for footage online .. and I think the way it's been moulded around out footage leaves the rest for dead. My opinion may be biased though

Shane

oddly it didn't this time for a number of hours so I thought YouTube was glitching but no, it was just delayed

Shane

I mean release one of me sleeping. I am sure it will be appeasing for all (joking of course)

Shane

I heard about that. They were told who to award the prize to for that question so they don't know the answer to the question you're asking them. If they respond telling you they are not sure, you will surely be upset. I think they were going to reply but didn't want to cause more problems as a few noisy people seem to have a good time using whatever they can against them these days. It was the first competition and things were hectic. I am sure there was a reason but the Community Manager doesn't know why and we've been too busy to chase people up and ask them to review for the sake of one answer

Shane

I think people have their own feelings and assume that everyone feels the same way. So when they convey how they feel they use words like 'everyone' and 'we all' (etc) to make it seem like everyone agrees with them. I also believe there are people in here who remain silent and have just had enough of some of the drama and just want to talk about other things

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:42:15 EST
the way I have seen the Community Manager treated by some in here would not have been tolerated by our previous Community Managers if they were treated the same way. Odd that people would intentionally go out of their way to cause problems they would not normally create around the previous Community Manager and then expect to be ignored and wrapped in cotton wool

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:40:21 EST
I'm sorry the two don't seem to connect, so really not sure what it's implying

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:39:46 EST
you would need the right type of prospecting CDs as a first step. Not sure if there will be other requirements but that would be a bare minimum

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:39:05 EST
I am not sure what "what was the point of uploading 2 videos instead of just 1?" is supposed to mean. We uploaded a video and set to premiere. I don't know where we stated we uploaded 2 videos

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:36:46 EST
I don't know what you mean

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:36:22 EST
oh sneaky little trick

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:35:35 EST
plan to

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:35:27 EST
later - we're not cramming everything in and remember most of this footage is from months ago (apart from some I wanted to add to give a bit of context around a few things and show a little something off)

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:34:26 EST
a good pair of quality headsets will just enhance the viewing I think, not saying any more
14:33:21
I think just over 7 mins. But doesn't feel that long as it flows pretty nicely and packs in quite a lot to take in

Shane
12/01/2023 at 14:32:15 EST
brought a few tears down my cheeks when I saw the final version with all the little additions. Hope everyone enjoys it
14:30:34
can we stop with the pings putting the Community Manager down please? She's just doing her job. It's the first account most of you will go to and hope for help when you need it, so what is the point coming in here and tagging her with negative comments?

Shane
11/30/2023 at 06:19:47 EST
anyway, I am off. Sorry guys, I have a lot to do and never enough time to do it. Have a good day

Shane
11/30/2023 at 06:19:03 EST
it was, and now it has 2 extra minutes for a few reasons you will find out when it premieres. And I put up my hand in the discord announcement and asked for forgiveness as a gesture of me apologising. I think if I dropped in earlier and said it might be delayed without people seeing it is uploaded, ready to go would have caused more stress and disappointment until people did see it uploaded. But thanks for your feedback, just know I did consider that but weighed against doing it for the above reason

Shane
11/30/2023 at 06:15:41 EST
oh course there are - it's not me alone! I am just telling directing between 5-6 people. But it's a lot on top of an already busy schedule. Not sure people can understand unless they are in the situation I guess
06:14:17
Sorry about it being late, I have OCD with things like that .. there are still things that are bugging me but it's close enough I guess. Hope everyone will enjoy it

Shane
11/30/2023 at 06:12:47 EST
I do care, probably too much. I have to learn to care less to be honest, it affects my health and mentality a lot. But I do care, as I said, probably too much. I had to work those updates into my already crazy schedule meaning I slept 10 hours in the past almost 5 days now. Probably not the best time for me to be chatting in here due to current level of stress / tiredness but just wanted to say I do care.

Shane
11/29/2023 at 07:38:09 EST
CM will deal with it
07:38:06
too busy, sorry guys
07:38:02
I am not going to get involved

Shane
11/26/2023 at 13:01:25 EST
hi there - sorry I am off guys. 4am and I need to wake up fairly early. I am sure the CM will post the announcement on other socials when they are free, I just posted on Discord + my twitter. Bye all

Shane
11/26/2023 at 13:00:34 EST
that is a separate article, also very complex

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:59:55 EST
nono lunch break 1st year uni

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:59:12 EST
1 - I think I have answered this in the past, both are complicated and require a lot of thought before we approach it. It's come up numerous times but we have higher priorities unless we want to delay something else. 2 - No, I think all are active now linking perfectly together. Two places for E-ther and four for Essence

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:57:20 EST
sleep! Sorry, I am really tired guys .. my weekend has been non-stop work, I really need some sleep

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:56:30 EST
not sure what you mean there

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:56:01 EST
if by hitting the gym you mean sitting in my chair giving my back so much of a work out I can feel it, then yes, have been hitting it hard daily

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:54:13 EST
the first video we're going to drop will give some indication on the progress we've made on #E2V1. The second video is yet undecided what we are going to show, but it may include some game play which would be cool. The second video we show also depends a little on whether something else happens in time or not, so I'll just leave it at that

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:51:03 EST
I am not committing to any dates sorry, even broad ones like that, but I think you know what I want to do. We're pushing it, high priority. Compared to other studios we only have a very, very small team working on this and while we're making more hires, it's a lot of work for a small team. We're pushing hard, I and the team want to get the pre alpha out too

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:48:47 EST
for the token, yes

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:47:45 EST
yeah I love that footage, watched it so many times and found it enjoyable so I thought others might too

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:46:55 EST
I have answered that a few times elsewhere I believe

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:46:05 EST
there is a lot of information in the article, it explains a lot in more detail. You can probably see why I said I couldn't just summarise everything into one comment on discord

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:45:08 EST
I can't say when exactly, it's in the pipeline but we're working on quite a number of things.
12:44:26
almost 4am and has been a very full on weekend .. I am also off to bed now. Hope you all have a good day / night / evening wherever you are

Shane
11/26/2023 at 12:43:22 EST
Earth2Team and Earth2CM are sleeping and I wanted to get the article out as it's held up a few things with some ongoing issues the devs have been resolving. It's not 100% clear so I am breaking protocol a little but we need to keep moving!
