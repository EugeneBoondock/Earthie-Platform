Civilians will work on a per-property basis with us initially being allowed a maximum of 5 civilians per property for properties of 4 tiles or more. There will be 5 civilian types or classes to begin with. The Data Analyst analyzes your property and droid data to give you useful insights. The Droid Technician will automatically charge your droids for you when idle.  The Ether Dispenser will automatically dispense or give the Ether collected by your droids. The Raid Commander will allow you to assign your droids to auto-raid, although this will only be repeatedly going to the same property over and over. They wonâ€™t be exploring or finding new property for you.
