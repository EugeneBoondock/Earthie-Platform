What Are Territories?
Territories are predetermined areas of land where borders have already been set in Earth 1, such as States, Provinces, or Counties. They are, for the most part, dependent on or form part of a Country. The introduction of Territories is unlike anything seen in Earth 2 to date in that each Territory release is exclusively determined by the votes submitted by active Earth 2 Players. When a Territory is voted to be released by the Players, it eventually gets locked into a release queue of Territories (see Territories Release section of the article).  Only after this process, once a queued Territory is released, does the option for purchasing T3 land appear within that specific Territory.

Tier 3 Land is the final Tier of land, there will not be a Tier 4. It is the base builder Tier land and although limited in some respects is also quite a speculator given its unique ability to lure neglected E-ther from the Boosted E-ther Pools, effectively allowing T3 la to accumulate E-ther and Essence despite T3 tiles being unable to attract E-ther directly from Earth 2 (see Boosted E-ther Pool  + T3 SEED section of article).
