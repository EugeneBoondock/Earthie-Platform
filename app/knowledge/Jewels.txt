Combine 3 of the same type of jewel to make 1 jewel of 1 higher tier.
purple jewel = 1 t2 ochre jewel + 1 t2 blue jewel
orange jewel + 1 grey jewel + 1 sandy jewel
sunrise jewel = 1 blue jewel + 1 red jewel + and 1 grey jewel
sunset jewel = 1 sandy jewel + 1 purple jewel + 1 orange jewel
jamaica jewel = 1 black jewel + 1 yellow jewel + 1 green jewel

For T1 tiles only here is what you need to upgrade the quality of a jewel using
cracked jewel as a starter: Cracked to Cloudy = 3 shards 3 essence, Cracked to
Common = 9 shards 9 essence, Cracked to Clear = 18 Shards 18 essence, Cracked to
Luminous = 30 Shards 30 Essence
For T2 tiles only here is what you need to upgrade the quality of a jewel using
a cracked jewel as a starter: Cracked to Cloudy = 6 shards 6 essence, Cracked to
Common = 18 Shards 18 essence, Cracked to Clear = 36 shards 36 essence, Cracked
to Lumi = 60 shards 60 essence
For T3 tiles only here is what you need to upgrade the quality of a jewel using
a cracked jewel as a starter: Cracked to Cloudy = 12 shards 12 essence, Cracked
to Common = 36 shards 36 essence, Cracked to Clear = 72 shards 72 essence,
Cracked to Lumi = 120 shards 120 essence
Crafted jewels come out as cracked and can be upgraded to increase quality, to
upgrade a jewel, add said jewel to crafting and input shards, the amount of
shards may vary for the level of quality you want to achieve and essence equal
to the amount of shards used will be required to make any upgrade.
Note that each luminous upgrade has a small chance of becoming a brilliant
quality.
Using 24 shards alone will make any base jewel of your choice.
To make shards put any jewel you want to shatter into crafting and hit shatter
To craft brilliant jewels you need to upgrade the quality of any jewel to
luminous and there is a small chance it will become a brilliant.

Crafting certain jewels:
There are five different versions of these jewels announced — cracked, cloudy,
common, clear,
luminous and brilliant. All of these versions are expected to bring multiple
levels of utility in other
areas of Earth 2 like generating higher quantity resources, functionalities in
PVP games, etc.
There are three components required to make these different-tier jewels.
1. Tier 1 Jewels (Blue, Black, Ochre, Anthracite, Sandy, Yellow, Grey, Green)
2. Shards — Which are created by Shattering (breaking down) other jewels {Shards
can be
used to create new cracked jewels, each cracked jewel requires 24 shards, only
Tier 1
types of jewels can be made from shards, but remember they will be cracked
jewels}
3. Essence {Only when improving Jewels}
Using various combinations of the above three, you would be able to build
various forms of new
jewels.
Failed attempts to create rare Jewels will destroy the original Jewels and
create shards. Shards
can be re-combined to make original Jewels but will cost you essence. So follow
Earth2
community users to get working recipes to avoid this scenario.
Tier 2 Jewels of basic colors (Blue, Black, Ochre, Anthracite, Sandy, Yellow,
Grey, Green) can
be formed by combining 3 Tier 1 Jewels of the same color. You must ensure the
jewels are
added to 3 different slots.
How are shards made?
Shards can get created during the below 3 scenarios:
Shattering a jewel
As leftovers, while creating a new jewel
When a jewel creation fails when trying a new recipe.
